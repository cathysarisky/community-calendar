                        <p>Since 2004, the Petaluma River Marathon/Half-Marathon has been hosted on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend by Petaluma’s North Bay Rowing Club (est. 1984). Taking advantage of excellent conditions, a beautiful natural venue and the fortunate coincidence of the length of our tidal slough (13.1 miles to San Pablo Bay), it is one of the most beautiful and fun races on the west coast. This year marks the 20th anniversary of this exciting people-powered boating race. 

The event is open to practically any rowed or paddled craft, and is a joy to witness from shore, too!

The race can be viewed from Petaluma River Park (start/finish); along the river trail through Alman Marsh (from the Sheraton) and from the lookout at Shollenberger Park and along the riverside portion of Shollenberger trail. Gilardi's Lakeville Marina is a good place to view the half-marathon turnaround as well as marathoners as they head out and back. Sundrop Sauna now has a semipermanent sauna and plunge at Gilardi's (book a session online), and there is a picnic table and restroom at this location too. 

***Note: The North Bay Rowing Club boatyard is NOT able to host spectators. Please find another location along the riverfront from which to enjoy the race.*** 

***Note: prospective competitors should register online at Regatta Central:*** https://www.regattacentral.com/regatta/?job\_id=9091

The races begin launching at 6:30 am and will finish before noon. Best viewing: 7 am-10:30 am.</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

Upstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm **www.upstairsartgallery.net**

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

Upstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm **www.upstairsartgallery.net**

                        <p>**Latin Hits! Rhythm! Nostalgia! Romance! ¡Un apasionante viaje musical por la música y la cultura latina!**

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Hace mucho frío en Omaha, pero las cosas se calientan cuando cuatro jóvenes se encuentran en Burrito World. Descubren que todos comparten el nombre popular José, pero raíces diversas; puertorriqueña, cubana, mexicana y dominicana. Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

                        <p>Why do we dance?  To express emotion; to share tacit understanding with each other; to permit soul a fresh embodiment of meaning.  Dance affirms and celebrates being alive, creative, and connected.  It is a long-hoped-for dream to invoke the spirit of dance at THE 222 by hosting an event intended for all ages, dance backgrounds, and experience levels. 

This season, we are delighted to introduce dance nights @ THE 222 programmed by Lily Thrailkill.  Lily is a dancer with roots in East Coast Swing and blues fusion.  She began dancing in 2015, and continues to share her enthusiasm and skills wherever the music plays. Mark your calendars for the first Monday of each month, 6:30 – 9:30 PM at THE 222 and bring a friend. A lesson offered in the first half hour – no partner required. Stay for the party! September, 2024 – June, 2025.

We’ll be dancing East Coast Swing to a DJ’d medley of classic and contemporary tunes.</p>

                        <p>As of today, Fall Session is OPEN FOR ENROLLMENT at Sonoma Gymnastics Academy!

Starting September 3rd, we'll be rolling out some brand new classes as well as old favorites for children aged 1-18. Our GymNinja program uses aspects of Parkour and Martial Arts to entertain high-energy kids with obstacle courses. Our gymnastics classes teach girls and boys poise, flexibility, and strength. For homeschooling parents, we're a licensed vendor through Heartwood. We have devoted, experienced coaches ready to make sure your little one has a fun time.

We'd also like to introduce the following classes:

Tumbling & Dance – Students’ time will be split between learning gymnastics tumbling and practicing fun, short dance routines. Meant to help with fitness while remaining entertaining, this is a great class for kids who want to get in shape and be active.

Tumbling & Conditioning – This 7+ class will help kids learn handstands, walkovers, cartwheels, flips, and more high-intensity tumbling techniques. Supported by full-body conditioning workouts, this is a helpful class for kids who want to learn how to tumble, get in shape, and strengthen their core.

Developmental Play – This unique class will be led by our trained child development coach, who has a Master’s Degree in Special Education. The purpose is to create an environment that’s welcoming and nurturing for children who need extra support. Guardians will accompany their children on the floor to work on basic motor skills, socialization, autonomy, and (most importantly) play! Music will be kept at low levels, and activities will focus on simple, no-fail tasks.

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

                        <p>Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experience needed, all are welcome!!

This group is more than one individual and is held by volunteers, if you are interested please contact through the information below.

Art therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no matter what we are going through in life, we still have the ability to create and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into therapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going on internally. In that way, we can come back to pieces that represent specific times in our life!

- sonni king

We all need means of expression and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible way to heal.

There are so many things and burdens we carry in life, and not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a space where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating something is beautiful, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we learn about that feeling from a different perspective.

Art therapy will include art supplies, group grounding and group sharing, feel free to bring unfinished projects, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone who wants to volunteer their time, donate, guide the group, or have any questions should contact me here:

707-396-9318

Or contact Arlene Francis center

Thank you so much and I'm very excited to continue the gatherings that Sonni originally created.

                        <p>Creed Bratton's story has always been a music story, but a relentless drive for success and a stroke of luck led him down an entirely different path in Scranton, PA. Now, as he prepares to release his 10th studio album, *Tao Pop*, on September 27, Bratton cements his place in music history as he blissfully explores his many interpretations of pop music.

*Tao Pop* marks Creed’s fifth time working with multiple Grammy Award-winning producers Dave Way (Michael Jackson, Fiona Apple) and Dillon O’Brian (Keith Urban, Brian Wilson, Ringo Starr). To collaborate on four individual tracks, he brought in longtime friends Billy Harvey, Geoff Pearlman, Vance DeGeneres, and Dillon O’Brian.

The album’s artwork was inspired by Ray Kurzweil’s *The Singularity Is Near*; after reading it, Creed envisioned the image while meditating, imagining a world where AI-bots and humans coexist seamlessly. In this dream, Creed is the last human standing, thriving in a world dominated by robots and AI—a poignant metaphor for his enduring presence in the music world.</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

                        <p>Join us in supporting our community by participating in this drive-thru food distribution. Help distribute fresh produce, healthy groceries, and pantry staples to those in need. 

Here's what you need to know:

All volunteers, including children, must register individually before their volunteer shift

Volunteers under the age of 18 must have a guardian present. If volunteering without a guardian, prior approval is needed from both the guardian and Redwood Empire Food Bank staff.

For essential information about volunteering and answers to common questions from our volunteers about what to expect, we require all volunteers to read our Volunteer Handbook. 

Respect, fairness, and kindness are essential. Negative remarks or harassment will not be tolerated. Civil Rights training is required for volunteers aged 18\+

Expect to lift 15-35 lbs and be on your feet throughout the entire shift.

Speak to your Site Coordinator if you need food assistance.

Tech-savvy? Consider assisting with W5 sign-in support.

Distribution Site Safety:

Please arrive at your volunteer shift on time and report to the Site Coordinator. Staff will go over safety and assign duties at the beginning of the shift. 

This is a drive-thru distribution, so be prepared to load cars with food and with all aspects of the food distribution, from set-up to clean-up.

Dress brightly or wear a safety vest, wear closed-toed shoes, bring water, and dress in layers.

Thank you for helping us provide nutritious food to 142,000 individuals. Our priority is to feed the community and offer a great volunteering experience. For inquiries, please contact \(707\) 523-7900. This volunteer opportunity is located at

This session is for those who already know how to center and throw pieces successfully! A continuation of our all levels course, this intermediate level course will help you hone your throwing skills through more complex demos, and nuanced approaches to technical throwing. Expand your fundamentals and begin to develop your own voice in this 8 week course with Ben. In addition to throwing, surface decoration techniques will be explored as well as the opportunity to experiment with different clay bodies.  Sonoma Ceramics is excited to roll out new sliding scale, accessible pricing for our classes. With this new payment option, materials for the course are now included in the price of the class. Course price includes a single 25 lb. bag of clay, and glazing and firing for said clay. Additional bags of clay can be purchased through the studio and/or office.

With your 8 week class registration, students receive the opportunity to purchase a studio pass for ½ off during the duration of their class. Sign ups for membership will be included in your preclass email.

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

Learn the basics of machine sewing during this four-session class especially for beginners. Everyone will design and sew their own reversible tote bag. Bring your own sewing machine or use one from our studio. All materials are provided.

Week 1: Learn about the machine – what everything is called and how it works. Then jump right in and practice sewing straight and curved lines.

Week 2: Become more familiar with threading your machine, winding the bobbin, and changing stitches. Learn about interfacing and how to use a pattern. Begin designing your tote bag by choosing fabric for the interior, exterior, and handles.

Week 3: Start cutting and sewing your project. Learn about pinning, seam allowances, pressing seams, and clipping corners.

Week 4: Complete your bag by assembling the parts and adding a row of topstitching. You’ll be proud of all you’ve learned and have the confidence to begin sewing clothes, home decor, quilts, toys, and more!

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

Sarah Baker is a "blue-eyed soul" singer, songwriter, composer and pianist who has landed international radio airplay and performed on concert stages with legendary artists ranging from Etta James to Tom Petty.

The Northern California artist performs soul-blues music with a rock edge, offering hints of Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, and Susan Tedeschi. Her vocals have been described as soaring, gritty, tantalizing and unforgettable. Her songs, instrumentals and lyrics reflect the soulful heartbeat of Memphis and Muscle Shoals, the Southern vibe of Nashville, and the rock 'n' roll free spirit of Woodstock.

Sarah grew up surrounded by gospel, blues, country, bluegrass and rock 'n' roll in a West Tennessee working class family. She began piano lessons at age 6, often accompanying her father to country churches for all-day singings. She studied briefly after college at University of Memphis, moonlighting at Beale Street clubs, and absorbing the influence of Stax and Sam Phillips.

She later performed in New Mexico with the theater troupe The Kaleidoscope Players, the band Mother Fox, and a group mentored by actor Dennis Hopper called Dolly and The Lama Mountain Boys. She signed briefly with London Records before launching a successful career as a solo independent artist.

Cuts from her "Sarah Baker" album have received extensive radio airplay around the world, climbing various Gavin record charts. Her Zydeco tune "Use It Or Lose It" climbed into the top-five in southern Louisiana. Sarah's newly released album, "Baker's Dozen,” her third, includes blues rock swagger tune, “Revolving Door Man,” and the empowering rhythm ballad "Build That Bridge.”

She has performed at noted venues including the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, the Portland Blues Festival, and the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

Sarah has expanded into film and television by composing music for “I Married the War," a documentary about the spouses of combat veterans, and is working on a memoir.

Join our Drawing & Painting Open Studio and work on independent projects in a community environment. These uninstructed sessions are a great way to continue your work from one of our classes, get advice from other artists, and engage in lively conversation. Participants can work in any medium from oil to acrylic, from pastel to watercolor, from pencil to pen and ink. This group will keep you engaged and inspired! Bring your art supplies. We provide easels, tables and chairs.

Work on your own drawing and painting projects in a relaxed social atmosphere at the Sonoma Community Center. Bring your supplies – oil, watercolor, acrylic, pencil, pen – and hang out. Work from a still life, a photo, your memory or your imagination. Have a nibble, sip some wine, and engage with others who love art. Participants are welcome to bring a beverage or snack to share.

Open Studio does not include formal instruction. A monitor is available to help you with studio equipment, tools, and materials. Open Studio is for those with some experience who are ready to work independently.

You are welcome to arrive at 5:00 PM to use the full period, or arrive when it’s convenient for you.

Keep in mind that this is a shared space so please leave enough time to help clean up.

Your art supplies and work can not be stored at the Center between sessions. Please take everything with you when you leave.

For your own safety and those around you, Non-Toxic Studio Hygienics apply. Rather than solvents, including Gamsol, alternative non-toxic methods are to be used. Let’s protect our health and the environment.

Cancellations: Please note that we are unable to issue refunds. If you register but find that you cannot attend your $10 will be considered a donation to the studio.

The Sonoma Community Center may substitute Drawing & Painting Open Studio monitors with other instructors, advanced students or staff members at any time without notice.</p>

**Sarah Baker** is a "blue-eyed soul" singer, songwriter, composer and pianist who has landed international radio airplay and performed on concert stages with legendary artists ranging from Etta James to Tom Petty.

The Northern California artist performs soul-blues music with a rock edge, offering hints of Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, and Susan Tedeschi. Her vocals have been described as soaring, gritty, tantalizing and unforgettable. Her songs, instrumentals and lyrics reflect the soulful heartbeat of Memphis and Muscle Shoals, the Southern vibe of Nashville, and the rock 'n' roll free spirit of Woodstock.

Sarah grew up surrounded by gospel, blues, country, bluegrass and rock 'n' roll in a West Tennessee working class family. She began piano lessons at age 6, often accompanying her father to country churches for all-day singings. She studied briefly after college at University of Memphis, moonlighting at Beale Street clubs, and absorbing the influence of Stax and Sam Phillips.

She later performed in New Mexico with the theater troupe The Kaleidoscope Players, the band Mother Fox, and a group mentored by actor Dennis Hopper called Dolly and The Lama Mountain Boys. She signed briefly with London Records before launching a successful career as a solo independent artist.

Cuts from her "Sarah Baker" album have received extensive radio airplay around the world, climbing various Gavin record charts. Her Zydeco tune "Use It Or Lose It" climbed into the top-five in southern Louisiana. Sarah's newly released album, "Baker's Dozen,” her third, includes blues rock swagger tune, “Revolving Door Man,” and the empowering rhythm ballad "Build That Bridge.”

She has performed at noted venues including the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, the Portland Blues Festival, and the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

Sarah has expanded into film and television by composing music for “I Married the War," a documentary about the spouses of combat veterans, and is working on a memoir.

                        <p>**Rockin' the River’s** 13th annual high octane concert series at the historic Guerneville Plaza returns for the first of two music-filled nights on Thursday, May 23rd.

A family-friendly, dancin'-in-the-street party, Rockin' the River kicks off at 6:00pm with powerhouse covers from the Sonoma County youth band **Ga$Money**, followed at 7:00pm by Guerneville’s own troubadour, **Willie Perez** performing a blend of Blues, Folk and Pop. **Sebastian Saint James,** the 2023 Norbays winner for best male vocalist, and his band will burn the stage from 7:30 to 9pm with their intoxicating blend of Indie, Soul and Blues. This line-up is sure to bring you to your feet and keep you there! **La Fogata**, **Oso Good Dogs** and **Smart Pizza** will be on hand to provide food breaks.

Arrive early to take advantage of the wonderful **Russian River Farmers' Market** which operates every Thursday, May through September from 3pm to 7pm and is within walking distance to the Plaza. Rockin' the River concerts delight locals and visitors alike as concert goers celebrate great music, a beautiful corner of the world and each other.

The brick plaza at Guerneville's town center makes for a quaint and picturesque concert venue. The plaza lies at the base of Guerneville's circa 1922 metal truss walking bridge and is adjacent to Guerneville River Park and a short stroll to Main Street shops and Johnson's Beach. Exuding small town charm, Guerneville is well known for its natural beauty, laid-back attitude, friendly population, good restaurants and proximity to wine-tasting, redwood forests and the spectacular Sonoma Coast.

**Rockin’ the River’s second show happens on September 5th** with a South and North of the border celebration featuring Spike Sikes and His Awesome Hotcakes, Maxima Frecuencia and Maya Latin Roots.

Special thanks to the Russian River Recreation and Park District for taking a lead role in making "Rockin' the River" possible. And many, many thanks to all our sponsors and friends of the series. It truly takes a village.

                        <p>Rockin' the River’s 13th annual high octane concert series at the historic Guerneville Plaza returns for the final music-filled night of the season on Thursday, September 5th with a south and north of the border celebration.  
A family-friendly, dancin'-in-the-street party, Rockin' the River kicks off at 6:00pm with brass, soul and a whole lot mo’ from Spike Sikes and His Awesome Hotcakes, followed at 7:00pm by Maxima Frecuencia’s regional Mexicano sounds. Maya Latin Roots will take the stage between from 7:45 to 9pm with their captivating and uplifting blend of Spanish and English music that everybody knows. Maya covers all standard Latin styles including, Cumbia, Salsa, Latin Rock, Cha Cha, and Latin Old School. This line-up is sure to bring you to your feet and keep you there! La Fogata, Oso Good Dogs and Smart Pizza will be on hand to provide food breaks.
Arrive early to take advantage of the wonderful Russian River Farmers' Market which operates every Thursday, May through September from 3pm to 7pm and is within walking distance to the Plaza. Rockin' the River concerts delight locals and visitors alike as concert goers celebrate great music, a beautiful corner of the world and each other.
The brick plaza at Guerneville's town center makes for a quaint and picturesque concert venue. The plaza lies at the base of Guerneville's circa 1922 metal truss walking bridge and is adjacent to Guerneville River Park and a short stroll to Main Street shops and Johnson's Beach. Exuding small town charm, Guerneville is well known for its natural beauty, laid-back attitude, friendly population, good restaurants and proximity to wine-tasting, redwood forests and the spectacular Sonoma Coast. 
Special thanks to the Russian River Recreation and Park District for taking a lead role in making "Rockin' the River" possible.  And many, many thanks to all our sponsors and friends of the series.  It truly takes a village.

A Raven original.

Two German officers are billeted at the home of a Jewish family on the outskirts of Paris in 1940. One officer is drawn to the woman of the house, and she to him in this moving, star-crossed love story that explores the human struggles in a world at war.

"At the beginning of the German occupation of Paris in 1940, my Jewish grandmother and a German officer who was billeted in her home crossed the boundaries set by the war. I wanted to tell their very human story, set against the inhumanity of war.” - Francine Schwartz

                        <p>It's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

Scott Capurro!
Scott Capurro Live! - Erect Since 1994!
Scott played Aunt Jack in Mrs. Doubtfire , and a rubber head in Star Wars; Phantom Menace . He’s been edited on 8 Out of 10Cats and The World Stands Up , but left to self-destruct on other television stuff, including Rove , which got him banned in Oz. Oh well.
Total Edinburgh Fringe sell-out since 1994. Not to be missed.

Do you struggle to mix the exact colors you envision in your oil paintings?

This in-person course is designed for artists like you, who want to build a strong foundation in color mixing with oil paints. Over eight, 3-hour weekly sessions, you’ll gain the knowledge and skills to confidently create a full spectrum palette tailored to your unique artistic vision.

Through a combination of hands-on practice, engaging discussions, live demonstrations, and comprehensive handouts, you’ll:

Master the fundamentals of color theory, including the color wheel, primary and secondary colors, and color relationships.

Explore the unique characteristics of oil paints and how they influence color mixing.

Develop your ability to create a vast range of colors through precise mixing techniques.

Learn how to achieve subtle variations in hue, saturation, and value.

Gain the confidence to mix any color you need for your paintings.

Discover how to personalize your palette to best suit your artistic style.

This course provides a progressive learning experience, building your skills week by week. By the end, you’ll be equipped to confidently mix vibrant, harmonious colors that elevate your oil paintings to the next level. This is not a class where students will be making paintings; we will explore color mixing with oils and learn how to develop working palettes along with some basic color science for understanding.

These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

                        <p>Guide Dogs for the Blind (GDB) offers walking tours of its California campus in San Rafael, to give visitors the opportunity to learn about and observe the training and nurturing required to help these puppies on their journey to become guide dogs for people who are blind or visually impaired. Daily tours can accommodate up to 36 people, and reservations are required at least a week in advance.

The tours, which last a little more than an hour, include a stop at the Learning Lab in GDB’s state-of-the art Puppy Center, where all GDB puppies will spend the first critical eight to 10 weeks of life. The Puppy Center also includes areas for puppy birthing and puppy socialization. The Learning Lab is an educational center to expand the public’s understanding of what it takes to make a successful guide dog. While the Learning Lab stop is educational, it’s been known to melt even the most cynical heart, with its views of puppies playing, rolling, running, and mugging for selfies. The tour also includes outdoor stops in the training courtyard and the residential courtyard, where visitors learn about training and other aspects of GDB’s three programs: Guide Dog Mobility Program, Orientation and Mobility (O&M) Program, and K9 Buddy Program. Visit GDB tours for more information and to book your tour. 

Tours run Mondays through Fridays at 10 am, July 1 through December 30, 2024.

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

Upstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm **www.upstairsartgallery.net**

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

Upstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm **www.upstairsartgallery.net**

                        <p>Join artists Ken Berman and newcomer Alina Nuebel on September 6th, 5-8 PM, in the SOFA Santa Rosa Arts District at Backstreet Gallery + Studios for a show that is by turns architectural and organic, playful and quiescent, unpacking the joy and turmoil of human innovation and its parallels in the evolution of life on earth, finding the art in science, and the science in art.

Ken Berman is a Northern California, self-taught, Outsider Artist whose work combines the energy of the urban environment with the mechanics of our modern age.  His work often incorporates a variety of mediums and techniques with ideas meant to engage the viewer’s full imagination.

Alina Nuebel is a biologist and artist who combines the fine-focus eye of a field scientist with an expressive, painterly energy to invite as sense awe for the humble or overlooked aspects of the environment we walk through every day.

Come prepared for a fresh perspective where Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics are energized with Art to create a show that transcends the world of the ordinary.</p>

                        <p>The best of times might also be the worst of times. These are our times and what characterizes them? What might an artist offer as a sign of our times?
 
“Signs of Our Times” is the theme of the Santa Rosa Art Center’s September and October exhibit. Artwork that reflects or portrays the qualities and experiences that shape who we are now and how we address our modern experience. Such art might offer a message of hope or signal a warning. It might celebrate new freedoms or expose new tyrannies. In sum, this art expresses the emotions and perceptions associated with the joys, fears or griefs at the crest of our current lives.

A Raven original.

Two German officers are billeted at the home of a Jewish family on the outskirts of Paris in 1940. One officer is drawn to the woman of the house, and she to him in this moving, star-crossed love story that explores the human struggles in a world at war.

"At the beginning of the German occupation of Paris in 1940, my Jewish grandmother and a German officer who was billeted in her home crossed the boundaries set by the war. I wanted to tell their very human story, set against the inhumanity of war.” - Francine Schwartz

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

                        <p>It's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

                        <p>It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.
This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

Things rapidly and uproariously take a turn for the worse, and that's BEFORE they break out the rum. Speaks to our deeply divided society, where identity politics and tribalism have superseded civility and kindness. Adult language and themes of racism, sexism, and homophobia.</p>

Legendary band, Three Dog Night, now in its 6th decade, produced more top 10 hits and sold more records and concert tickets than any other band between 1969 and 1974. Its signature blend of mainstream rock and pop sensibilities, captured in catchy melodies and strong vocal harmonies, continues to weave through the fabric of pop culture today, whether on the radio, in TV commercials or in major motion pictures. 

Three Dog Night holds a Billboard Magazine record for releasing 21 consecutive Top 40 hits, including three \#1 singles. That success drove seven platinum-selling singles and 12 straight RIAA Certified Gold LPs. The hits appeared on best-selling charts in all genres – pop, rock, rhythm & blues, and country. Its records continue to sell around the world, including Japan, Canada, Holland, England, Germany, and Spain. Tens of millions of Three Dog Night records have been sold through the years. 

Created in 1968 by Danny Hutton, Three Dog Night maintains an aggressive, year-round touring schedule of over 90 dates a year, performing their hit filled concerts for multi-generational audiences. 

The group’s eclectic taste, combined with its ability to recognize and record hits in a unique, distinctive, and appealing style, resulted in Three Dog Night dominating the charts for years. The band’s music transcends time, bringing together both new and longtime audiences alike.

                        <p>Want to do a thru-hike from Sugarloaf to Hood Mountain or vice versa? Ride the Sugar-Hood Shuttle!

**How it works** Every half hour, our Shuttle will leave from either Sugarloaf Ridge State Park's Visitor Center (making a brief stop at the Goodspeed parking lot) or Hood Mountain Regional Park’s Pythian Rd parking lot (with a brief stop at the equestrian lot). Make a reservation to ride to the other end of the trail and begin your hike, or hike and ride back. We recommend riding first and hiking back to your car afterwards– no worries about how long you take to finish your adventure. The hike should take 3½ to 4½ hours; the distance is about 7.4 miles one way with approximately 2,300ft of elevation gain. Bring at least 64oz of water and sun protection, as the majority of the trail is exposed.

                        <p>Jack London State Historic Park is partnering with the Sonoma Community Center to present four plein air art workshops at the park on Sept. 7 and 14, and Oct. 12 and 26, 2024.

The programs will be led by Hannah Day, a Sonoma County artist who works primarily in the paper arts. She received her MFA from UH Manoa in printmaking, and her etchings are internationally shown and collected. Her personal practice also includes paper cutting, graphite, watercolor, and mixed media.

Plein Air Tree Sketching in Multimedia – Saturday, Sept. 7 and Oct. 12, 10 a.m.-1 p.m.

The natural beauty of Jack London State Historic Park - where thousands of native Valley Oak, Coast Live Oak, Bay Laurel, Manzanita, Sequoia flourish - provides inspiration for this three-hour workshop. Participants will join instructor Hannah Day at the park and select one tree to spend time with, drawing its detailed portrait while receiving instruction on proportion, placement, texture, line weight, and value. Once students have an established drawing, they will explore the values of their tree with inventive colors in watercolor or colored pencil. Participants will practice and build observational drawing skills, spend time in nature, and have fun with color.

No prior drawing experience is necessary and beginners are welcome.  The class is open to adults ages 18 and older. All materials are provided but students are welcome to bring a mixed media sketchbook.

Tickets are $60, with a $5 materials fee.  The park entry fee is $10 per vehicle for up to nine passengers.

Tickets and additional information are available on the Sonoma Community Center website:

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

Have you realized that publishing isn’t the final goal? Wouldn’t it be great if your network actually read your book and discovered how valuable your content is so they can buy from you and/or refer you? What’s your strategy to use this book to wake up and engage your network? Our workshop presenter, Robbie Samuels, will cover four areas: timing, building a launch team, getting 50\+ Amazon reviews, and designing a virtual book launch party.</p>

                        <p>The Petaluma Historical Library & Museum invites you to join our living history docents–the “Petalumans of Yesteryear”–dressed in period attire for a guided tour of our historic downtown. Petaluma has a unique and fascinating history as a bustling river town during and after the Gold Rush, then as the “Chicken and Egg Capital of the World,” and now as a town that loves its history. Learn about Petaluma’s incredible architecture (including 8 sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and other important and interesting facets of our town’s history. You’ll be informed by your docent’s historical knowledge and entertained by their characters’ stories.</p>

                        <p>Join us for two days of festivities featuring local and regional wines, local restaurants and chefs, coastal artists and musicians, who all come together to support health and wellness on the Mendocino Coast.

Winesong isn’t just an event, it’s a cherished coastal tradition for locals and vistors alike. Winesong has often been referred to as an annual family reunion because that’s what it is – friends from near and far, old and new, gathering for this joyful event that supports healthcare on the coast.

For 2024, we’re creating an intimate Winesong family gathering by hosting the major events: Wine Leaders Panel, A Pinot Noir Celebration, the Grand Tasting and the Live Charity Auction, all at Little River Inn. Little River Inn has been affectionately dubbed Winesong South as they’ve hosted the Pinot Celebration for years with gracious hospitality and generosity. 

A silent auction will be held during the grand tasting event. The Live Auction follows the Grand Tasting with lively bidding and lunch prepared by Little River Inn's Chef Marc Dym. . As per usual, we’ll offer numerous wine lots — rare vintages, large formats, and vertical offerings — plus trips, experiences and, of course, our traditional 52 bottles of bubbly.

We look forward to seeing you this September and hope you'll be inspired to make plans to attend our 40th anniversary of Winesong in 2025, back at the beloved Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens — it’ll be our Ruby Jubilee!</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

                        <p>This year’s 2024 theme is Garden Party, where guests will get to experience a favorite summer pastime enjoying fine wine, delicious fare, and live music in a breathtaking outdoor setting at HALL St. Helena’s 33-acre property. This is also the site of HALL’s historic Bergfeld Winery building. 

At the core of the annual Harvest Celebration is the opportunity for guests to learn more about HALL’s flagship wine, the Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon. This wine is consistently defined by its core of dark, succulent fruit from the Sacrashe Vineyard located just above the Rutherford Appellation at the top eastern ridge of the Vaca Mountain range in Napa Valley. 

Since the first vintage was produced in 1996, the Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon has been one of the highest rated wines in HALL’s portfolio, earning over 150 scores rated 90 points and above from the industry’s top critics including The Wine Advocate, Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast, Jeb Dunnuck, Vinous and The Wine Independent. Additionally, Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon earned the #2 spot in Wine Spectator’s “Top 100” list in 2011. The 2021 vintage of this wine has earned four ratings between 94-98 points from The Wine Independent, Vinous, Jeb Dunnuck and Owen Bargreen respectively.

                        <p>Calling all chili enthusiasts to enjoy this spicy annual savory showdown! Organized by the Windsor Chamber of Commerce, this beloved community event promises a day filled with delicious chili, local libations, and vibrant entertainment, all in support of Food for Thought, a local nonprofit organization dedicated to meeting the nutrition needs of people in Sonoma County.

Attendees will have the opportunity to sample all of the creations and cast their votes for their favorite in the People’s Choice category. An expert panel of judges will determine the winners for both the Traditional and the Homestyle competitions.  Witness as teams are announced given their cash prizes and trophies!

New Local Entertainment: Dustin Saylor is a Northern California home grown American country singer and songwriter.  His sound has been compared to Thomas Rhett, Chris Stapleton, Chase Rice and Tyler Childers.

By participating in the Windsor Chili Cook Off, attendees and sponsors alike contribute directly to this vital cause.

                        <p>Get Out And Vote (https://deedsgetoutandvote.art/get-out-and-vote)  was a campaign that PAC organized in 2020. The goal was to be a creative force in getting out the vote locally and to impact efforts nationally. PAC is doing it again and our goal is the same: combining art and action to Get Out And Vote.  

 

Everyone is welcome and we hope that parents will also join their children for an afternoon of making Get Out And Vote posters. PAC will provide all the materials: poster board, stencils, paint, stamps, paper, photographs. Anything that you need, you name it!

 

We can accommodate 30 people max in our classroom and in our exhibition space.  You can hang your poster on the cyclone fence opposite the art center (we’ll help you to hang it) or you can display your poster at home.  

 

Please sign up in advance and submit your $15 fee for materials. We’ll be ready for you.

                        <p>It's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

                        <p>It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.
This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

                        <p>Join us for a safari-inspired gala where we embark on a journey filled with laughter, excitement, and purpose.
Adding to the excitement of the night, we are delighted to present Comedian Steve Bruner as our host and emcee. Steve has delivered his laser-sharp humor on Comedy Club Network (Showtime), An Evening at the Improv (A&E) and more. He’s played clubs across the country, including The Comedy Store, The Improv, The Comedy & Magic Club, Catch a Rising Star, and The Ice House.

During the event, you will have the opportunity to engage in both a silent auction and a live auction, presenting exclusive items for bidding. We are excited to announce local celebrity, Brent Farris, as our extraordinary auctioneer. We appreciate Brent's advocacy of wildlife conservation in schools throughout our community, supporting the efforts of the Discover Africa program.

Join us and indulge in a delectable evening of great food and exquisite hosted wines in support of the youth programs at Safari West. Your support is an investment in the future for our youth and wildlife conservation. These programs serve as crucial platforms for our youth in Sonoma County, the Greater Bay Area, and across the United States.  

Safari West LIVE brings interactive live safari programs to children in hospitals across the US, supporting mental health and hope for wellness. The young explorers look forward to these programs, and to interact with a Safari West Naturalist. The children literally light up when they see their favorite Safari West resident such as a giraffe or lemur. 

Junior Keepers learn empowerment and skill-building while learning about the wild residents at Safari West.  The Junior Keeper program provides teens with opportunities to discover their passions, develop essential life skills, and foster meaningful connections within their communities.                       

Discover Africa provides Sonoma County and Greater Bay Area 3-12 grade students from underserved communities with excursions to Safari West to educate and engage young conservationists. In classroom education materials complete the program, supporting teachers with projects and in classroom learning.

Your support will nurture the potential of an individual participant and also contribute to the broader societal fabric, fostering a more inclusive and prosperous future for all. Through mentorship, education, and access to resources, we can and have inspired young people to become conservation leaders, innovators, and changemakers, driving positive change and creating a brighter tomorrow for generations of humans and wildlife to come. 

We genuinely look forward to seeing you at "An Evening on the Serengeti".

Panel with experts - Brad Onishi, Peter Coyote and Rev. Dr. David Vasquez-Levy

Moderated by Rev. Dr. Curran Reichert

Special Appearance by Congressman Jared Huffman

Burlingame Hall 6:00 - 8:00 pm

SEPTEMBER 7th

$25 Ticket

Brad Onishi will be leading a panel of experts in a focused conversation on the history and rise of Christian Nationalism and the threat of Project 2025 to every American citizen. Brad is a former evangelical Christian Nationalist who after leaving high school, married, and took a job as a full time youth minister with plans to enter the seminary, eventually came to view evangelicalism as inextricably intertwined with American Nationalism, white supremacy, patriarchy and xenophobia. 11 years after joining the church, he left his faith behind to pursue a career as a writer and academic. He is now dedicated to educating the Nation with his insider knowledge at talks across the nation, books TV and Radio shows, and his podcast, "Straight, White American Jesus".


Joining him will be Peter Coyote, an actor, activist, documentary narrator and most recently a Buddhist Priest who is dedicating his life to educating people about the threats to Democracy, and how to cope with these threats from a Buddhist perspective. Peter is well known for his educational talks and inspirational approach on the fundamental teachings of the Buddha to modern life, and also has a new book out "Zen in the Vernacular".


Also, a special appearance from Rev. Dr. David Vasquez-Levy, who is the President of the Bay Area's largest theological faculty in North America, the Pacific School of Religion (PSR) where they are dedicated to teaching and living a radically inclusive gospel and the fight for peace, social just and equality. David has recently joined the fight against Christian Nationalism through educational films and talks throughout his community.

From the PSR website - "As a progressive Christian seminary and graduate school, PSR is firmly committed to serving the church and nonprofit organizations. PSR welcomes students from all denominations and religious backgrounds. We embrace diversity and are committed to racial, gender, sexual orientation, economic, and social justice."


Rev. Dr. Curran Reichert, pastor of the First Congregational Church of Sonoma and a PSR alum, will be moderating the panel. Curran has her Doctor of Ministry in Organizational Development from Chicago Theological Seminary and has pastored progressive communities of faith in the United Church of Christ for more than two decades. She is passionate about decolonizing American institutions, securing equitable access to education, just wages, and fairly priced housing for everyone in the Sonoma Valley.</p>

                        <p>Location: The Block Petaluma, 20 Grey Street, Petaluma</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Join us as we return to The Block from 6 until 9 PM for another fun evening of free music, great people, full bar, and food trucks at one of Petaluma's best local venues!

Founded by Jason E. Davies on the heels of the pandemic, The Social Contractors offer an upbeat blend of melodic original rock and classic covers from the 60s-90s. Jason’s tightly crafted tunes feature improvised solos with pointed lyrics that span edgy political and environmental themes to tales of unrequited love and introspection – all with an ultimately optimistic perspective on the possible.

Jason E. Davies began playing guitar in his early teens and played in multiple Santa Cruz based bands (The Void, Sid Allen & The Devil's Den, and Fun With Colors) in the 90s and graduated from UCSC with a degree in Politics (double major in Environmental Studies), before ultimately pursuing a career in the audio technology products industry. 

The pandemic provided the impetus for producing a pandemic themed song ("Social Contractor"), which ultimately led to founding The Social Contractors band with Dan Ellecamp on drums and Rob Neidel on bass and vocals. Travis Thayer, a locally based saxophone and keyboard player then joined the group after hearing the band at a party. 

This event will be a "power trio" iteration of the group, featuring Rob Neidel on bass and vocals, Nick Schneider on drums, and Jason E. Davies on lead and rhythm guitar and vocals. Come rock the Block with The Social Contractors on Saturday, September 7th, from 6 to 9 PM!</p>

                        <p>Get ready for a night of electrifying rock 'n' roll as the smoldering New York City duo SUSU returns to Sonoma for their third performance, brought to you by local Jocelyn Simone. This unforgettable event will take place on Saturday, September 7th, 2024, at the historic Sebastiani Theatre. 

SUSU, featuring firebrand Black lead vocalists and songwriters Liza Colby (Liza Colby Sound/Brass Against) and Kia Warren (Revel In Dimes/Rocktopia), is known for their high-energy performances and provocative style. These modern-day tummlers are set to seduce, spiritualize, and slay with their unique blend of variety and rock 'n' roll.

Opening the show is J. Graves from Portland, OR, known for their passionate dance-punk style. J. Graves delivers tense relationship rock with sanguine lyricism, secret-longing guitar music, and a rhythm section that thuds, skitters, and melts over the determined voice of lead singer Jessa Graves.

SUSU's first full-length album, "Call Susie" (2023), showcases their genre-bending, shapeshifting sound and the undeniable vocal prowess of Warren and Colby. This album is a testament to the band's dynamic range and their ability to push the boundaries of rock 'n' roll.</p>

                        <p>If you pass a San Francisco bar on a Friday night with a great long line of expectant patrons out front, chances are they’re all waiting to be propelled into the sonic time warp of a Cosmo Alleycats performance inside.

​

Cosmo Alleycats have been a favorite of the San Francisco music scene since the band’s 2010 beginning, bringing to the stage a potent mix of swing and vintage dance music with a dynamic, soulful delivery. Led by vocalist Emily Day \(“one of the major singers in her field” – Scott Yanow\), Cosmo Alleycats draws from several decades of exhilarating American music, along with inspired originals, to deliver a fun and engaging performance.

​

With thirteen years' experience performing together, Cosmo Alleycats is a well-oiled machine. But however polished their performance may be, it’s their sense of playfulness that holds the door open for the unexpected. This dynamic is evident in their 2022 album, Old Sweet Songs, a collection of Tin Pan Alley and American Songbook favorites accompanied by their original compositions, inspired by bygone styles of songwriting.

​

Cosmo Alleycats has performed at notable venues and festivals such as Blue Note Napa, Piedmont Piano Company, Ashkenaz, The Sound Room, House of Blues New Orleans, Maison Frenchman, Dreamforce, SeaWorld San Diego, Fillmore Jazz Festival, Reno's Hot August Nights, and the Russian River Jazz & Blues Festival. You can catch the band playing regularly at Local Edition, Mr. Tipple's, and Club Deluxe in San Francisco, and you've likely seen them at your cousin's wedding or your company's Holiday Party.</p>

A Raven original.

Two German officers are billeted at the home of a Jewish family on the outskirts of Paris in 1940. One officer is drawn to the woman of the house, and she to him in this moving, star-crossed love story that explores the human struggles in a world at war.

"At the beginning of the German occupation of Paris in 1940, my Jewish grandmother and a German officer who was billeted in her home crossed the boundaries set by the war. I wanted to tell their very human story, set against the inhumanity of war.” - Francine Schwartz

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

                        <p>Christopher Hampton's translation of the award-winning comedy by Yasmina Reza. Two couples meet to discuss a fight between their young sons. Things rapidly and uproariously take a turn for the worse, and that's BEFORE they break out the rum. Speaks to our deeply divided society, where identity politics and tribalism have superseded civility and kindness. Adult language and themes of racism, sexism, and homophobia.</p>

                        <p>Born and raised in the Fillmore District of San Francisco, Andre Nickatina has been a Hip-Hop/Rap luminary since the release of his critically acclaimed debut, The New Jim Jones. A favorite at public venues and on college campuses, Andre Nickatina continues to sustain a loyal fan-base, while engaging new supporters throughout North America. Nickatina’s classic stage show combined with his rare interviews, maintains his mystery and unique musicianship that has spanned two decades.

The longevity of Nickatina speaks for itself. An award-winning MC and producer (2005 Bay Area Artist of The Year / Album of The Year for Bullets), Nickatina’s vision has expanded beyond the 18 albums (and hundreds of thousands of sales) that he has executive-produced. Also, a diverse artist, Nickatina has gained critical acclaim for his work and vision as a filmmaker, with more than seven films to his credit as either a director, co-director, executive producer, producer or actor.

Changing his name from Dre Dog to Andre Nickatina in 1996, he transformed his career to a plateau that has allowed him to create and develop an entirely new fan base with his original flow, distinct voice and lyrical explorations that few other MCs have displayed an ability to achieve. His third album, Raven In My Eyes, marked Nickatina’s shift as an artist and expanded his audience to the wildly enthusiastic college crowds that praise him with regular sellouts from coast to coast. In 2008 Nickatina completed a timeless masterwork that paired he and his friend, Mac Dre (R.I.P.) together with the new classic, A Tale of Two Andres.

Nickatina’s business acumen is as sharp and honorable as his presence on stage. Nickatina’s vision as an artist has been admired by many of his peers as he is seen as one of the last Bay Area Legends who was not only present during the golden-era of Hip-Hop, but one of the few artists who has helped Hip-Hop grow and who has remained ultimately relevant with each successive album he has released. Without saying so, Nickatina has had his finger on the pulse of what is raw, uncut and capable of capturing the mind and ears of listeners. Never one to follow or ride trends, Andre Nickatina is a rare breed of artist… one of the last original trend setters. Nickatina does not do what the people want… rather the people want to know what Dre will do next.</p>

                        <p>Want to do a thru-hike from Sugarloaf to Hood Mountain or vice versa? Ride the Sugar-Hood Shuttle!

**How it works** Every half hour, our Shuttle will leave from either Sugarloaf Ridge State Park's Visitor Center (making a brief stop at the Goodspeed parking lot) or Hood Mountain Regional Park’s Pythian Rd parking lot (with a brief stop at the equestrian lot). Make a reservation to ride to the other end of the trail and begin your hike, or hike and ride back. We recommend riding first and hiking back to your car afterwards– no worries about how long you take to finish your adventure. The hike should take 3½ to 4½ hours; the distance is about 7.4 miles one way with approximately 2,300ft of elevation gain. Bring at least 64oz of water and sun protection, as the majority of the trail is exposed.

**Registration is required** as there is only space for 5 riders at a time, but you can ride on a space-available basis as well. There is no charge for the ride, the $10 reservation fee is refunded on site the day of the event, unless you choose to donate it to keep this service running. **Dogs and bikes are not allowed in the shuttle or on Goodspeed Trail** (the State Park portion of the hiking route). Parking fees apply.</p>

                        <p>Join us for a very late summer hike on Lafferty Ranch, where the headwaters of Adobe Creek cascade down the west side of Sonoma Mountain. With Joe Cochrane, our knowledgeable naturalist docent, guiding us, you'll discover the fascinating flora and fauna that make this 270-acre property unique. Lafferty Ranch is the only publicly owned land on this side of the mountain, and since the summer of 2022, LandPaths has been leading hikes here to unveil its rich history and stunning natural features.

Our adventure will take us through diverse terrains, from sweeping, gentle meadows to steep, challenging hillsides. You'll be rewarded with breathtaking views of the Petaluma Valley, stretching south to the peaks of Mt. Tamalpais and Mt. Diablo, and even reaching as far as San Francisco. The trail winds through ancient oak and bay tree groves along Adobe Creek, offering a serene backdrop with a total elevation gain of 500 feet.

As we ascend above the creek, we'll make our way to a stunning vista point at the mid-point meadow. Here, we'll pause to soak in the panoramic views and enjoy some well-deserved snacks before heading back. Don’t miss this chance to explore the natural beauty and captivating landscapes of Lafferty Ranch!

                        <p>"The Seed of McCoy" begins as a two-fisted tale of adventure on the high seas.  The action takes place in French Polynesia, visited by Jack and Charmian London during the Cruise of the Snark in 1907-1908.  Like other London stories, it is partly based on a true story. It was published in Century magazine in 1907 and 1911 as part of the “South Seas Tales.”

Storyteller Jeff Falconer reads "The Seed of McCoy" aloud under the majestic oaks for a special Jack London morning.  A discussion and refreshments follow the reading.

More than 100 years later, the same area was visited by Nancy and Rob Novak, Sonoma County residents and real-life sailors who left on their cruise of a lifetime in 2012 that lasted 14 years. During that time, unknowingly, they visited the same area in French Polynesia and much more.  To continue the story and learn more about their adventures, attend "The Story of the Snark and Cruise of the Shindig" on Sept. 28.

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

Upstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm **www.upstairsartgallery.net**

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

Upstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm **www.upstairsartgallery.net**

A Raven original.

Two German officers are billeted at the home of a Jewish family on the outskirts of Paris in 1940. One officer is drawn to the woman of the house, and she to him in this moving, star-crossed love story that explores the human struggles in a world at war.

"At the beginning of the German occupation of Paris in 1940, my Jewish grandmother and a German officer who was billeted in her home crossed the boundaries set by the war. I wanted to tell their very human story, set against the inhumanity of war.” - Francine Schwartz

Holus Bolus is Tom Boylan, a one-man, multi-instrumentalist known as the "One-Man-Psychedelic-Acousti-Loop" artist. With a small drum kit, acoustic guitar, and foot pedals, he builds songs layer by layer, creating an acoustic-psychedelic groove-rock sound. As Tom says, "It's like a philosopher-juggler...you throw up one ball at a time until you get a good thing going, then vocalize about life, love, aliens, and existence-all at once."

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

                        <p>This brainchild of Camilo Lara creates irresistible beats for the global dance floor. At home in Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Lagos, Mumbai, or New York, Camilo’s music can be heard in any of the new capitals of world culture. His live shows can only be described as punk performances that bring down the house every single time. This ethos has taken him around the globe, performing in every single continent.

His work has landed him 1 Grammy and 4 Latin Grammy nominations, and he has produced artists ranging from Los Angeles Azules \(scoring the bestselling Mexican album of the last 25 years, 8 times diamond-certified sales\), Lila Downs, Norah Jones, and Band of Horses. He has remixed Beck, the Beastie Boys, Interpol, Run the Jewels among others.

Ritmos Tropicosmos is a seven-piece psychedelic cumbia group, from Oakland, creating heavy tropical rhythms with an emphasis on live percussion, synthesizers and familial stories put into song. Together in a time-warped crossroads of electric and acoustic instrumentation, Ritmos Tropicosmos stands somewhere within the traditional rhythms of the past and the futuristic soundscapes of The Now.</p>

RITMOS TROPICOSMOS
Ritmos Tropicosmos is a seven-piece psychedelic cumbia group, from Oakland, creating heavy tropical rhythms with an emphasis on live percussion, synthesizers and familial stories put into song. Together in a time-warped crossroads of electric and acoustic instrumentation, Ritmos Tropicosmos stands somewhere within the traditional rhythms of the past and the futuristic soundscapes of The Now.

We’ll keep the drinks pouring and the music loud. We’re talking fresh, limited-edition, TapRoom-only beers that you can’t get anywhere else. Think you’ve tasted it all? Think again. And the food? Oh, get ready to drool. Our locally-foraged food trucks are serving up dishes so good you’ll wanna awkward dance. Arrive early, fill up on grub, and get ready for a night of legendary moments.</p>

                        <p>**life into “Hallelujah.” She puts her indelible touch on songs by Leonard Bernstein, Randy Newman, James  Taylor and more.** 

**In 2012, she released the CD/DVD Judy Collins Live At The Metropolitan Museum Of Art which aired on PBS. This special television program was nominated for a New York Emmy and won a Bronze Medal at the 2013  New York Festival International Television & Film Awards. Based on it’s success, in 2014 she filmed  another spectacular show in Ireland at Dromoland Castle. Live In Ireland was released in 2014. This  program also won a Bronze Medal at the 2014 New York Festival International Television & Film Awards and the program will broadcast on PBS in 2014 and 2015.** 

**Judy has also authored several books, including the powerful and inspiring, Sanity & Grace and her  extraordinary memoir, Sweet Judy Blue Eyes: My Life in Music. For her most recent title to be released in  2017, Cravings, she provides a no-holds barred account of her harrowing struggle with compulsive  overeating, and the journey that led her to a solution. Alternating between chapters on her life and those of  the many diet gurus she has encountered along the way (Atkins, Jean Nidtech of Weight Watchers, Andrew  Weil, to name a few), Cravings is the culmination of Judy's genuine desire to share what she's learned—so  that no one has follow her heart-rending path to recovery.** 

**In addition, she remains a social activist, representing UNICEF and numerous other causes. She is the  director (along with Jill Godmillow) of an Academy Award-nominated film about Antonia Brico – PORTRAIT  OF A WOMAN, the first woman to conduct major symphonies around the world–and Judy's classical piano  teacher when she was young.** 

**Judy Collins, now 77, is as creatively vigorous as ever, writing, touring worldwide, and nurturing fresh talent.  She is a modern day Renaissance woman who is also an accomplished painter, filmmaker, record label  head, musical mentor, and an in-demand keynote speaker for mental health and suicide prevention. She  continues to create music of hope and healing that lights up the world and speaks to the heart.**</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

                        <p>We invite you to attend one of our upcoming free seminars so you can take the first step toward having peace of mind by creating (or updating) your estate plan.  This is an educational seminar, where we highlight some of the concerns that many families face and how an estate plan can help.  The attorneys also break down how wills and trusts differ, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and how to avoid them.

Our goal is to provide you with the education you need to protect yourself and your family, and leave a legacy of peace. If you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further, we offer all participants who complete the seminar a free, no obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.

At this seminar, we will discuss several common issues and concerns, including:

The advantages and disadvantages of wills, living trusts and probate
Protecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-spouses, lawsuits, and other claims
Most living trusts fail; if you already have a trust find out what you can do to ensure that it will protect you and your loved ones
How to preserve your nest egg for your family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care
How to stay out of court and avoid the cost, time and stress that a conservatorship can bring if you become incapacitated.
Attend a seminar and receive a FREE no-obligation consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions about setting up your estate plan ($425 value).</p>

Kevin Hutchinson & Friends - Every Tuesday!
Coming from the tradition of folk music, Kevin Hutchinson is a musical storyteller. His influences and styles cover many genres: folk, folk rock, blues, rock, rockabilly, Americana, country, swing, and, of course, folk. His music is lyric driven, and spans topics from love to social commentary, serious to light hearted.
Kevin loves connecting with the audience with his originals and thoughtful covers of artists that have inspired him, often pulling from their lesser known material.
Artistic influences, covering decades, include: John Prine; Bob Dylan; Bruce Cockburn; Warren Zevon; Crosby, Stills and Nash; Peter, Paul and Mary; Robert Earl Keen; Tom Russel; Tom Paxton; Paul Thorne; and many more.

                        <p>Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experience needed, all are welcome!!

This group is more than one individual and is held by volunteers, if you are interested please contact through the information below.

Art therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no matter what we are going through in life, we still have the ability to create and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into therapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going on internally. In that way, we can come back to pieces that represent specific times in our life!

- sonni king

We all need means of expression and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible way to heal.

There are so many things and burdens we carry in life, and not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a space where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating something is beautiful, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we learn about that feeling from a different perspective.

Art therapy will include art supplies, group grounding and group sharing, feel free to bring unfinished projects, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone who wants to volunteer their time, donate, guide the group, or have any questions should contact me here:

707-396-9318

Or contact Arlene Francis center

Thank you so much and I'm very excited to continue the gatherings that Sonni originally created.

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

                        <p>Join us in supporting our community by participating in this drive-thru food distribution. Help distribute fresh produce, healthy groceries, and pantry staples to those in need. 

Here's what you need to know:

All volunteers, including children, must register individually before their volunteer shift

Volunteers under the age of 18 must have a guardian present. If volunteering without a guardian, prior approval is needed from both the guardian and Redwood Empire Food Bank staff.

For essential information about volunteering and answers to common questions from our volunteers about what to expect, we require all volunteers to read our Volunteer Handbook. 

Respect, fairness, and kindness are essential. Negative remarks or harassment will not be tolerated. Civil Rights training is required for volunteers aged 18\+

Expect to lift 15-35 lbs and be on your feet throughout the entire shift.

Speak to your Site Coordinator if you need food assistance.

Tech-savvy? Consider assisting with W5 sign-in support.

Distribution Site Safety:

Please arrive at your volunteer shift on time and report to the Site Coordinator. Staff will go over safety and assign duties at the beginning of the shift. 

This is a drive-thru distribution, so be prepared to load cars with food and with all aspects of the food distribution, from set-up to clean-up.

Dress brightly or wear a safety vest, wear closed-toed shoes, bring water, and dress in layers.

Thank you for helping us provide nutritious food to 142,000 individuals. Our priority is to feed the community and offer a great volunteering experience. For inquiries, please contact \(707\) 523-7900. This volunteer opportunity is located at

What Moves You? is a contemplative experience of shared spiritual reflection upon a sacred text.

Join us the 2nd Wednesday of every month at 5:30 p.m. as leaders from different faith traditions within Sonoma County guide us based on the practice of Lectio Divina, or “Divine Reading.” We will hear a sacred text from the leader’s tradition in a contemplative manner, three times through. After each time, we will share responses and insights.

September 11 Presenter: Paul Mallatt is a deacon at The Episcopal Church of the Incarnation in Santa Rosa and a 26-year flight attendant with Southwest Airlines. He has served with the airline’s Critical Incident Stress Management \(CISM\) team for over ten years. Paul is also a spiritual director with the Journey Center.

This session is for those who already know how to center and throw pieces successfully! A continuation of our all levels course, this intermediate level course will help you hone your throwing skills through more complex demos, and nuanced approaches to technical throwing. Expand your fundamentals and begin to develop your own voice in this 8 week course with Ben. In addition to throwing, surface decoration techniques will be explored as well as the opportunity to experiment with different clay bodies.  Sonoma Ceramics is excited to roll out new sliding scale, accessible pricing for our classes. With this new payment option, materials for the course are now included in the price of the class. Course price includes a single 25 lb. bag of clay, and glazing and firing for said clay. Additional bags of clay can be purchased through the studio and/or office.

With your 8 week class registration, students receive the opportunity to purchase a studio pass for ½ off during the duration of their class. Sign ups for membership will be included in your preclass email.

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

                        <p>Circus Jam meets every Wednesday in our theater to work on their performance. If you would like to perform for people, come on out. Learn how to juggle. Hula hoop. Walking on stilts. Magic. Taming the lion... well... there are no lions here, but there are a bunch of people who like to perform and you can join them every Wednesday in the Theater at 6pm</p>

Learn the basics of machine sewing during this four-session class especially for beginners. Everyone will design and sew their own reversible tote bag. Bring your own sewing machine or use one from our studio. All materials are provided.

Week 1: Learn about the machine – what everything is called and how it works. Then jump right in and practice sewing straight and curved lines.

Week 2: Become more familiar with threading your machine, winding the bobbin, and changing stitches. Learn about interfacing and how to use a pattern. Begin designing your tote bag by choosing fabric for the interior, exterior, and handles.

Week 3: Start cutting and sewing your project. Learn about pinning, seam allowances, pressing seams, and clipping corners.

Week 4: Complete your bag by assembling the parts and adding a row of topstitching. You’ll be proud of all you’ve learned and have the confidence to begin sewing clothes, home decor, quilts, toys, and more!

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

                        <p>It's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

                        <p>We invite you to attend one of our upcoming free seminars so you can take the first step toward having peace of mind by creating (or updating) your estate plan.  This is an educational seminar, where we highlight some of the concerns that many families face and how an estate plan can help.  The attorneys also break down how wills and trusts differ, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and how to avoid them.

Our goal is to provide you with the education you need to protect yourself and your family, and leave a legacy of peace. If you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further, we offer all participants who complete the seminar a free, no obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.

At this seminar, we will discuss several common issues and concerns, including:

The advantages and disadvantages of wills, living trusts and probate
Protecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-spouses, lawsuits, and other claims
Most living trusts fail; if you already have a trust find out what you can do to ensure that it will protect you and your loved ones
How to preserve your nest egg for your family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care
How to stay out of court and avoid the cost, time and stress that a conservatorship can bring if you become incapacitated.
Attend a seminar and receive a FREE no-obligation consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions about setting up your estate plan ($425 value).</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

PDI exist as a source for early intervention services for children with severe dental needs, requiring more extensive care then can be delivered in a dentist’s office. The children referred to PDI require surgery under general anesthesia, averaging 12 of their typical 20 baby teeth being restored and some, unsalvageable and removed.

PDI is part of a wider coalition of early childhood healthcare providers who serve families that have been historically marginalized and underserved, experience barriers to timely access to healthcare, particularly dental. 

Our mission is to deliver safe, high quality, and specialized dental restoration and surgery to underserved youth and promote oral health through education to communities of Northern California. 

As part of the commitment to our patients’ long-term health, families receive free dental care kits and education on how to care for their children’s teeth moving forward. Last year we treated 1,500 patients. Overall, we have treated over 28,294 children.

By ensuring readily accessible care, we can improve overall health outcomes by treating the pain, inflammation and infection of severe tooth decay. Left untreated, these dental issues cause difficulty eating, drinking, sleeping and speech disorders due to the pain, plus unsettles behavior at childcare and school. A child’s confidence and self-esteem can also be negatively affected by visible tooth decay. 

According to Smile California, over 440,000 of California’s school-aged children missed school due to dental problems in 2018, leading to disruption of education and socialization, plus thousands of hours of missed work for their parent.

This seven-week studio course focuses on the fundamentals of drawing while exploring a variety of media, techniques, and subject matter from still life and landscape to the figure. We will use traditional and experimental approaches to drawing; students will develop an understanding of line, value, gesture, proportion, and form. Through demonstration, practice, and class discussion, participants hone the verbal and analytical skills necessary to critically examine their and others’ work. This course is appropriate for beginners and those wishing to further develop their drawing skills.

Please bring the following materials: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \(Char-kole brand black\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\).

Sarah Baker is a "blue-eyed soul" singer, songwriter, composer and pianist who has landed international radio airplay and performed on concert stages with legendary artists ranging from Etta James to Tom Petty.

The Northern California artist performs soul-blues music with a rock edge, offering hints of Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, and Susan Tedeschi. Her vocals have been described as soaring, gritty, tantalizing and unforgettable. Her songs, instrumentals and lyrics reflect the soulful heartbeat of Memphis and Muscle Shoals, the Southern vibe of Nashville, and the rock 'n' roll free spirit of Woodstock.

Sarah grew up surrounded by gospel, blues, country, bluegrass and rock 'n' roll in a West Tennessee working class family. She began piano lessons at age 6, often accompanying her father to country churches for all-day singings. She studied briefly after college at University of Memphis, moonlighting at Beale Street clubs, and absorbing the influence of Stax and Sam Phillips.

She later performed in New Mexico with the theater troupe The Kaleidoscope Players, the band Mother Fox, and a group mentored by actor Dennis Hopper called Dolly and The Lama Mountain Boys. She signed briefly with London Records before launching a successful career as a solo independent artist.

Cuts from her "Sarah Baker" album have received extensive radio airplay around the world, climbing various Gavin record charts. Her Zydeco tune "Use It Or Lose It" climbed into the top-five in southern Louisiana. Sarah's newly released album, "Baker's Dozen,” her third, includes blues rock swagger tune, “Revolving Door Man,” and the empowering rhythm ballad "Build That Bridge.”

She has performed at noted venues including the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, the Portland Blues Festival, and the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

Sarah has expanded into film and television by composing music for “I Married the War," a documentary about the spouses of combat veterans, and is working on a memoir.

**Sarah Baker** is a "blue-eyed soul" singer, songwriter, composer and pianist who has landed international radio airplay and performed on concert stages with legendary artists ranging from Etta James to Tom Petty.

The Northern California artist performs soul-blues music with a rock edge, offering hints of Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, and Susan Tedeschi. Her vocals have been described as soaring, gritty, tantalizing and unforgettable. Her songs, instrumentals and lyrics reflect the soulful heartbeat of Memphis and Muscle Shoals, the Southern vibe of Nashville, and the rock 'n' roll free spirit of Woodstock.

Sarah grew up surrounded by gospel, blues, country, bluegrass and rock 'n' roll in a West Tennessee working class family. She began piano lessons at age 6, often accompanying her father to country churches for all-day singings. She studied briefly after college at University of Memphis, moonlighting at Beale Street clubs, and absorbing the influence of Stax and Sam Phillips.

She later performed in New Mexico with the theater troupe The Kaleidoscope Players, the band Mother Fox, and a group mentored by actor Dennis Hopper called Dolly and The Lama Mountain Boys. She signed briefly with London Records before launching a successful career as a solo independent artist.

Cuts from her "Sarah Baker" album have received extensive radio airplay around the world, climbing various Gavin record charts. Her Zydeco tune "Use It Or Lose It" climbed into the top-five in southern Louisiana. Sarah's newly released album, "Baker's Dozen,” her third, includes blues rock swagger tune, “Revolving Door Man,” and the empowering rhythm ballad "Build That Bridge.”

She has performed at noted venues including the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, the Portland Blues Festival, and the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

Sarah has expanded into film and television by composing music for “I Married the War," a documentary about the spouses of combat veterans, and is working on a memoir.

                        <p>*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* returns to di Rosa with *Twelfth Night*, a romantic comedy of mistaken identity, set against the backdrop of di Rosa's stunning artwork and natural beauty. Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night* centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who become embroiled in a love triangle with the Duke Orsino, Countess Olivia, and each other. The story plays off gender confusion and mistaken identity to raise social critique, all served with a lot of laughs.

For *Shakespeare Summer Stroll*, SNV presents an abridged version directed by Jennifer King, and with live musical accompaniment arranged by music director Dr. Christina Howell. Audiences will follow a guided walking tour through the plot points of *Twelfth Night*, all set against the incredible artwork and natural backdrop of di Rosa. The production will feature award-winning Bay Area actor Tim Kniffin in the role of Malvolio, along with local professionals Matthew Cowell, Olivia Cowell, and Rio Codda working alongside apprentice actors from Napa Valley College.  

*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* is made possible in part by a Collaborative Arts and Culture Grant from the County of Napa Board of Supervisors.

A Raven original.

Two German officers are billeted at the home of a Jewish family on the outskirts of Paris in 1940. One officer is drawn to the woman of the house, and she to him in this moving, star-crossed love story that explores the human struggles in a world at war.

"At the beginning of the German occupation of Paris in 1940, my Jewish grandmother and a German officer who was billeted in her home crossed the boundaries set by the war. I wanted to tell their very human story, set against the inhumanity of war.” - Francine Schwartz

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

                        <p>It's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

Do you struggle to mix the exact colors you envision in your oil paintings?

This in-person course is designed for artists like you, who want to build a strong foundation in color mixing with oil paints. Over eight, 3-hour weekly sessions, you’ll gain the knowledge and skills to confidently create a full spectrum palette tailored to your unique artistic vision.

Through a combination of hands-on practice, engaging discussions, live demonstrations, and comprehensive handouts, you’ll:

Master the fundamentals of color theory, including the color wheel, primary and secondary colors, and color relationships.

Explore the unique characteristics of oil paints and how they influence color mixing.

Develop your ability to create a vast range of colors through precise mixing techniques.

Learn how to achieve subtle variations in hue, saturation, and value.

Gain the confidence to mix any color you need for your paintings.

Discover how to personalize your palette to best suit your artistic style.

This course provides a progressive learning experience, building your skills week by week. By the end, you’ll be equipped to confidently mix vibrant, harmonious colors that elevate your oil paintings to the next level. This is not a class where students will be making paintings; we will explore color mixing with oils and learn how to develop working palettes along with some basic color science for understanding.

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

                        <p>Guide Dogs for the Blind (GDB) offers walking tours of its California campus in San Rafael, to give visitors the opportunity to learn about and observe the training and nurturing required to help these puppies on their journey to become guide dogs for people who are blind or visually impaired. Daily tours can accommodate up to 36 people, and reservations are required at least a week in advance.

The tours, which last a little more than an hour, include a stop at the Learning Lab in GDB’s state-of-the art Puppy Center, where all GDB puppies will spend the first critical eight to 10 weeks of life. The Puppy Center also includes areas for puppy birthing and puppy socialization. The Learning Lab is an educational center to expand the public’s understanding of what it takes to make a successful guide dog. While the Learning Lab stop is educational, it’s been known to melt even the most cynical heart, with its views of puppies playing, rolling, running, and mugging for selfies. The tour also includes outdoor stops in the training courtyard and the residential courtyard, where visitors learn about training and other aspects of GDB’s three programs: Guide Dog Mobility Program, Orientation and Mobility (O&M) Program, and K9 Buddy Program. Visit GDB tours for more information and to book your tour. 

Tours run Mondays through Fridays at 10 am, July 1 through December 30, 2024.

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

                        <p>*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* returns to di Rosa with *Twelfth Night*, a romantic comedy of mistaken identity, set against the backdrop of di Rosa's stunning artwork and natural beauty. Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night* centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who become embroiled in a love triangle with the Duke Orsino, Countess Olivia, and each other. The story plays off gender confusion and mistaken identity to raise social critique, all served with a lot of laughs.

For *Shakespeare Summer Stroll*, SNV presents an abridged version directed by Jennifer King, and with live musical accompaniment arranged by music director Dr. Christina Howell. Audiences will follow a guided walking tour through the plot points of *Twelfth Night*, all set against the incredible artwork and natural backdrop of di Rosa. The production will feature award-winning Bay Area actor Tim Kniffin in the role of Malvolio, along with local professionals Matthew Cowell, Olivia Cowell, and Rio Codda working alongside apprentice actors from Napa Valley College.  

*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* is made possible in part by a Collaborative Arts and Culture Grant from the County of Napa Board of Supervisors.

A Raven original.

Two German officers are billeted at the home of a Jewish family on the outskirts of Paris in 1940. One officer is drawn to the woman of the house, and she to him in this moving, star-crossed love story that explores the human struggles in a world at war.

"At the beginning of the German occupation of Paris in 1940, my Jewish grandmother and a German officer who was billeted in her home crossed the boundaries set by the war. I wanted to tell their very human story, set against the inhumanity of war.” - Francine Schwartz

They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

**Show from 8:15-10:30pm with one intermission**

A musical showcase of two couples featuring sweet harmonies and captivating original songs

**The StriderFactor** (Jon Strider and Robin Factor). 

Originally from the SF Bay Area, Jon spent 16 years in the music trenches of LA before emigrating to Sweden in 2001, where he forged a music career that includes nine solo albums, two hit songs on Swedish National Radio, and widespread airplay throughout Europe. Jon's original songs connect deeply with listeners on themes such as love’s loss & fulfillment and the immigrant’s journey. He joined forces with life-long Sonoma County resident Robin in 2020. Their song 'In the days of Quarantine,' co-written and recorded during the C;ovid lockdown, was favorably received on local and Swedish airwaves. They divide their time between Malmö Sweden and Forestville CA.

**Lindalou and Michael Ryge** Sweetness, compassion, and a deep connection with the natural world infuse the songs of Lindalou and Michael, high school sweethearts who’ve been making music together since 1973. With beautifully blended harmonies and inventive lyrics they describe their life in the rugged hills above Calistoga, and their encounters with the modern world. Their job for the past several years is playing in elder care facilities where they mostly play old familiar standards and get folks singing along. Their first album 'Beginner's Luck' was released in 2003\[, and a 2nd album is in the works. These troubadours rarely perform in a showcase setting, so don’t miss this opportunity to experience the wit, sparkle and emotional depth of their music.

                        <p>The first collaboration of famed partners Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, Oklahoma! set the American musical theatre standard. Set in "Western Indian Territory" just after the turn of the 20th Century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for the love story between cowboy Curly, and farm girl, Laurey. The road to true love is anything but smooth as the road to romance and the road to statehood converge. Curly and Laurey must come to terms with their own hearts in a brand new state: O-K-L-A-H-O-M-A - OKLAHOMA!

Oklahoma! is a classic musical filled with memorable songs like "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'," "Oklahoma!," and "The Surrey with the Fringe on Top." Other hits include the romantic "People Will Say We're in Love," the lively "Kansas City," and the humorous "I Cain't Say No." These timeless melodies and lyrics have made Oklahoma! a beloved favorite in musical theater.

Performing at Sonoma State University - Warren Theater, Located in Ives Hall: 1801 East Cotati Ave, Rohnert Park, CA 94928
Parking is included with ticket price

                        <p>It's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

                        <p>Christopher Hampton's translation of the award-winning comedy by Yasmina Reza. Two couples meet to discuss a fight between their young sons. Things rapidly and uproariously take a turn for the worse, and that's BEFORE they break out the rum. Speaks to our deeply divided society, where identity politics and tribalism have superseded civility and kindness. Adult language and themes of racism, sexism, and homophobia.</p>

                        <p>Conservation Dinner Series: Dr. Jamie Gilardi of World Parrot Trust joins us in the elephant room after dinner to give a talk about wild parrots. The conservation dinner series is complimentary to all dinner guests. Jamie is a conservation biologist specializing in behavioral and physiological ecology with a special focus on tropical forest birds and marine vertebrates. He has studied wild parrots and other birds for more than 25 years. He first did undergraduate studies at the University of Washington and UC Santa Cruz, where he studied the evolution of predatory bird reversed-size sexual dimorphism. He then earned a Ph.D. in Ecology from UC Davis studying parrot social behavior, foraging ecology, and soil eating in South-eastern Peru.  From 1996 through 2000, Jamie was in charge of a number of projects for Wildlife Preservation Trust International and the Oceanic Society. Starting in 2000, Jamie became the Executive Director of the World Parrot Trust, where his responsibilities include developing, designing and implementing field conservation programs, policy planning and campaigning, grant writing, photo and video documentation of WPT projects around the world.</p>

                        <p>The StriderFactor (Jon Strider and Robin Factor):
Originally from the SF Bay Area, Jon spent 16 years in the music trenches of LA before emigrating to Sweden in 2001, where he forged a music career that includes nine solo albums, two hit songs on Swedish National Radio, and widespread airplay throughout Europe. Jon's original songs connect deeply with listeners on themes such as love’s loss & fulfillment and the immigrant’s journey. He joined forces with life-long Sonoma County resident Robin in 2020. Their song 'In the days of Quarantine,' co-written and recorded during the C;ovid lockdown, was favorably received on local and Swedish airwaves. They divide their time between Malmö Sweden and Forestville CA.

Lindalou and Michael Ryge
Sweetness, compassion, and a deep connection with the natural world infuse the songs of Lindalou and Michael, high school sweethearts who’ve been making music together since 1973. With beautifully blended harmonies and inventive lyrics they describe their life in the rugged hills above Calistoga, and their encounters with the modern world. Their job for the past several years is playing in elder care facilities where they mostly play old familiar standards and get folks singing along. Their first album 'Beginner's Luck' was released in 2003[, and a 2nd album is in the works. These troubadours rarely perform in a showcase setting, so don’t miss this opportunity to experience the wit, sparkle and emotional depth of their music.

                        <p>Did you know that this pond sits at the top of the Mark West Creek Watershed? And the creek, nestled in the bottom of the canyon, is one of a few tributaries of the Russian River that still supports a healthy population of endangered steelhead trout and is spawning habitat for coho salmon! Let's gather as a community to give back to these waters that have offered us so many memories and refuge from hot summer days! 
 
The pond provides habitat for a diverse variety of birds, fish, amphibians, and aquatic plants and has also been a place of gathering and joy for camp participants all summer long, so we invite you to join us in a stewardship workday focused on removing invasive species that are growing around and in the pond to help restore balance within the ecosystem and create more habitat for native species. We will also be celebrating the end of summer with food, swimming/water games, and maybe even turtle sightings! This event is family friendly so feel free to bring participants of all ages! 
 

WHERE: Rancho Mark West, Santa Rosa  - You'll receive actual address and driving directions upon registration. 
 
About Rancho Mark West: 
With accessible pathways and proximity to Santa Rosa, Rancho Mark West is our outdoor classroom, community hub, and wild place of refuge in the Mayacamas Mountains, 20 minutes from downtown Santa Rosa. This property is protected by the voters of Sonoma County who funded Sonoma County Ag+Open Space's work with a quarter-cent sales tax, in partnership with LandPaths and the Coastal Conservancy.
 
Rancho Mark West is located on the ancestral home of the Southern Pomo people and the Mishewal people, past, present, and future. We recognize them as the first people and the first stewards of this land. We are on occupied territory and acknowledge the ongoing devastation of colonization.

                        <p>September 14 @ 10:00 Am – 12:00 Pm

Start Date: Saturday, September 14 Time: 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM Total Sessions: 1 Instructor: Megumi Inouye Location: Room 201, Fiber Arts Studio Ages: Adults, 18\+ Skill Level: Beginning Registration Fee: $40 Materials Fee: $10

The custom of wrapping things in cloth dates back to ancient times. Furoshiki are traditional Japanese wrapping cloths that can be used to wrap elegant gifts, bind wine bottles, transform into a shopping bag and more. Join local author Megumi Inouye for a modern take on this eco-friendly and mindful technique. First, select your furoshiki \(to keep\) created from various upcycled textiles donated to the Fiber Arts Studio. Next, learn how to tie and untie the special knot used for wrapping, then how to wrap wine bottles, round canisters, and rectangular boxes. Lastly, you’ll practice turning your furoshiki into a bag to take home with you.

Comments from Megumi’s last furoshiki workshop at the Sonoma Community Center:

The instructor was thorough, friendly, moved the class at a pace so that everyone got the attention they needed. 

Megumi was so much more than just an instructor!

I can’t wait for Megumi’s next class.

Everything I was hoping for – and more!

Megumi will also share with you the meaning behind the wrapping as well as talk a little about the historic context and different uses of furoshiki. Her new book “The Soul of Gift Wrapping: Creative Techniques for Expressing Gratitude, Inspired by the Japanese Art of Giving” will be available to purchase at the workshop.

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm.

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm.

                        <p>You are invited to an open studio reception with 2 shows "The Sky is Falling" by Gale S. McKee and "Sonoma, Tales of a County" by Beth Failor. LIVE MUSIC + SNACKS + 17 artists will have their studios open!!!

Live Music + Snacks + Artistic conversation. "The Sky is Falling" is a show inspired by Iceland’s volcanic eruptions, mixed-media pieces incorporating chunks of beautiful pale blue-green “glass slag,” since glass shards, spewed into the sky, are often a by-product of such an eruption. Beth Failor will be exhibiting her new collection of paintings entitled "Sonoma, Tales of a County." This is an opportunity to visit other Fulton Crossing Artists in their studios and to enjoy live music by classical guitarist Gabe Becker.</p>

McKee,** is pleased to present her latest exhibition ***The Sky is Falling***, on display at the Fulton Crossing Art Gallery from Friday, August 30 through Sunday, December 1. The series comprises 11 multi-media paintings inspired by the powerful volcanic eruptions in Iceland in 2010, 2023, and 2024. An Opening Reception will be held on Saturday, September 14 from 1-4pm at 1220 River Road, Fulton, CA. Reception is free.

“After each eruption I became fascinated with their power and enormous local and far-reaching impact on Earth,” explains McKee. “Despite the danger’s volcanoes pose, I am drawn to the magnificent visual beauty that emanates from such an explosive event. The colors, the textures, the historical and geographical impact of the Earth and humans continues to fascinate me.” 

The mixed-media pieces (acrylic, glass, aluminum) - incorporating 3-dimensional chunks of pale green “glass slag” (representing volcanic glass shards) embedded into a support of canvas stretched over a hollow substrate that allows light to pass through the back, and aluminum strips and metal additions (representing metals erupted from a volcano).</p>

                        <p>It's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

                        <p>**Latin Hits! Rhythm! Nostalgia! Romance! ¡Un apasionante viaje musical por la música y la cultura latina!**

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

                        <p>It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.
This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

Welcome to Saturday Live Music Happy Hour with John Trubee at Barrel Proof Lounge ! Join us for a fantastic evening filled with great music and good vibes. John Trubee will be performing live, bringing his unique style and talent to our stage. Come enjoy some drinks, relax, and unwind after a long week. This event is the perfect way to kick off your weekend with some awesome tunes. Don't miss out on this special performance! See you there!

The mischievous musical creations of John Trubee are unlike anything else in the world of pop. Known by few and understood by fewer, the longtime songwriter, bandleader and now record-label owner has called Sonoma County home for more than 30 years, yet his hermetic lifestyle and rejection of all things commercial have kept him out of the spotlight—and he wouldn’t have it any other way.

                        <p>*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* returns to di Rosa with *Twelfth Night*, a romantic comedy of mistaken identity, set against the backdrop of di Rosa's stunning artwork and natural beauty. Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night* centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who become embroiled in a love triangle with the Duke Orsino, Countess Olivia, and each other. The story plays off gender confusion and mistaken identity to raise social critique, all served with a lot of laughs.

For *Shakespeare Summer Stroll*, SNV presents an abridged version directed by Jennifer King, and with live musical accompaniment arranged by music director Dr. Christina Howell. Audiences will follow a guided walking tour through the plot points of *Twelfth Night*, all set against the incredible artwork and natural backdrop of di Rosa. The production will feature award-winning Bay Area actor Tim Kniffin in the role of Malvolio, along with local professionals Matthew Cowell, Olivia Cowell, and Rio Codda working alongside apprentice actors from Napa Valley College.  

*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* is made possible in part by a Collaborative Arts and Culture Grant from the County of Napa Board of Supervisors.

                        <p>"Love Letters" -

Emigrating to the US in 1985, Roni Ben-Hur was one of the first Israeli jazz musicians to make his mark in New York City, blending bebop, Brazilian rhythms, and Middle Eastern influences into a cohesive and captivating sound. His latest record, Jazz Love Letters, the latest masterpiece in his forty-plus year career of performing, composing, recording and teaching jazz, is said to be yet another testament why the guitarist is widely regarded as one of the jazz-elite.

For this West Coast tour, Ben-Hur is bringing from New York the outstanding trumpeter Freddie Hendrix and extraordinary bassist Harvie S and will join up with Sylvia Cuenca on drums. 

“Ben-Hur remains a touchstone of classic style and swing…clean-toned, mellifluously melodic, but most importantly swinging, swinging, swinging.”  —  Andy Robson, Jazz

A Raven original.

Two German officers are billeted at the home of a Jewish family on the outskirts of Paris in 1940. One officer is drawn to the woman of the house, and she to him in this moving, star-crossed love story that explores the human struggles in a world at war.

"At the beginning of the German occupation of Paris in 1940, my Jewish grandmother and a German officer who was billeted in her home crossed the boundaries set by the war. I wanted to tell their very human story, set against the inhumanity of war.” - Francine Schwartz

Known for their timeless magic and powerful performances, the Grammy Award-winning perennial classic-rock favorite will draw on their deep catalog of hits including signature song “A Horse with No Name,” a #1 hit on Billboard’s Hot 100 in 1972.

On their way to becoming a global household name, America’s journey found them exploring a wide variety of musical terrain. Their best-known tunes, which also include “I Need You,” “Ventura Highway,” “Don’t Cross The River,” “Tin Man,” “Lonely People,” and “Sister Golden Hair” were cornerstones of 1970’s Top 40 and FM rock radio.

From their formative years, America has been a band capable of transcending borders with its uplifting music and positive message. Embracing a rainbow of divergent cultures, America’s audiences continue to grow, comprising a loyal legion of first, second and third generation fans, all bearing testament to the group’s enduring appeal.</p>

On the weekend of his passing, local musician and songwriter, John Courage, and his band tribute to one of America’s greatest songwriters, John Prine. Join us for compositions inspired by the original recordings with support from a great backing band, and a rotating cast of some of Sonoma county’s finest singers. This will be an evening with, so prepare yourself for two sets of John Prine Classics. This is surely not a night to be missed! John Courage started performing solo in 2001 shortly after recording a demo EP and his high school band parting ways. This quickly prompted a detour through various American musical idioms- before the genre we now know as Americana was as ubiquitous as it is now. Through many lineups over the following decades, and sonic detours - the one constant was the dedication to a great song at the heart of every tune. John has opened for Rambling Jack Elliot, Commander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen, The Devil Makes Three, The Brothers Comatose and has worked for years as a sideman in various bands, traveling across the country and the globe. Now entering his 13th year with the current trio lineup, John also has solo recordings due out this year and solo acoustic touring planned as a return to his roots as a singer songwriter.

San Francisco Comedy Competition Semi-Finals

Saturday, September 14, 2024, at 8:00 pm

$49

The San Francisco Comedy Competition is one of the most prestigious comedy events in North America, launching the careers of people like Patton Oswalt and Ellen DeGeneres. It’s an outrageously funny evening, where you will see the comedy stars of tomorrow competing for their chance at fame and fortune. Hundreds of comedians audition each year to compete. Only 30 are chosen. 

Many talented comedians have since emerged from this annual event to become major stars. The Comedy Competition develops its contestants by forcing them to adjust to a variety of audiences—comedy clubs, colleges, casinos, and theaters—while enduring the strain of an extended road trip. 

1977 Comedy Competition Champ Dana Carvey went on to “Saturday Night Live.” 1979 Champ Marsha Warfield went on to “Night Court” to star as Roz the bailiff. 1982 finalist Kevin Pollak has achieved a major film career, as has 1987 finalist Rob Schneider. Two first runners up, Ellen DeGeneres in 1985 and Mark Curry in 1989, landed their own TV series. 

With this history, the San Francisco Comedy Competition has earned its reputation as an important showcase of young entertainers who will make it.

San Fran Halen - Van Halen Tribute - Downtown Santa Rosa Live Music
Come join us at Barrel Proof Lounge for a night of epic rock music as San Fran Halen pays tribute to the legendary Van Halen! Get ready to rock out to classic hits and experience the energy of a live performance. This event in Downtown Santa Rosa promises to be a night to remember. Don't miss out on the opportunity to relive the magic of Van Halen's music in a vibrant atmosphere. Grab your friends and get ready to dannnnnnce the night away!
Van Halen took all the best elements of 60s and 70s rock, fused them with the panache and pageantry of vaudeville, shot them into orbit with high velocity guitar unlike the world had ever seen. From Runnin' with the Devil to Jump, they single-handedly saved hard rock and ushered in the glorious musical excesses of the 80s. San Fran Halen is a group of San Francisco Bay Area pros who have joined the ranks of the world's best Van Halen tributes to pay homage to the joy etched in the indelible grooves on the sacred platters we have cherished since childhood. Scott McKenzie on drums, Michael Freeman on bass, Rob Spinosa on guitar, and rock n roll ringmaster Mikki J. Fox have sworn on their honor to do their best to do their duty to bring the party to you like it's 1984. It's never too late to have a happy adolescence.

This will be a "Kill Tony" type of format with comedians bringing their best 6 minutes to the stage in hopes of winning the nightly cash prize, a future performance, and the adoration of our awesome audience!

The comedians will be competing for "Set of the Night" which earns them a cash prize and a paid spot on the next Iron Ox Comedy Night (Last Saturday of each month).

                        <p>LLEAGLES – The premier tribute to the music of the Eagles

What do people want when they go see a live band? The members of SF Bay Area based tribute band ILLEAGLES believe that everyone in the crowd wants to be engaged and captivated from the first note until the show is done. Over the past year and a half of sold out performances, that is exactly what every crowd has gotten.

ILLEAGLES was founded in late 2016 when 6 friends came together who all had 2 things in common: 1) they loved the music of the Eagles, and 2) each member was an amazing musician in their own right. This common vision led to hours and hours of studying, rehearsing, and mastering each of the Eagles classic hits.

From rockers Life in the Fast Lane and Heartache Tonight, to swooning ballads Desperado and Best of My Love, ILLEAGLES not only reproduce the soaring guitars, multi-part harmonies and tightness of the original band, but also add their own brand of swagger and energy that keeps fans coming back over and over. It’s commonplace for a majority of the audience to start singing along on the first song, and continuing to sing until the show is over (or they lose their voices).

*ILLEAGLES- A high energy, unforgettable party that leaves fans wanting more…*</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

                        <p>Join us as we welcome back Falconer Rebecca Rosen and her family of raptors!

Two Sessions Available: 10:30AM-12:00PM and 1:30PM-3:00PM

We're excited to have skilled falconer Rebecca Rosen back with a host of feathered and taloned friends! We'll learn about how these birds are of such incredible importance to ecosystems all over the world, including our local vineyards, protecting them from invasive pests. We'll be outside in our native garden, enjoying the sunshine and raptors! We're so lucky to have this chance for one on one experience with these incredible animals. 

Please remember that we have limited parking, as we share our lot with Westwood Hills Park, which is popular on the weekends. We suggest you come early if you'd like to avoid parking on the street. There is also extra parking on Thompson Ave.

Thank you so much, we hope to see you at this exciting event!

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

                        <p>Activities depend on the season, and might include invasive species removal, pruning, mulching, mowing and other seasonal needs. If it's hot, you can also take a dip in the swimming pond after the work is done!
 
We'll cater the task to your ability! Volunteer land stewardship days like this are the best way to experience Ocean Song Preserve, which is closed to public access. The day will be led by LandPaths' wonderful volunteer garden steward Jan Lochner. 
 
About Ocean Song/Myers Preserve:
Ocean Song-Myers is an iconic 800-acre protected preserve in west Sonoma County, off Coleman Valley Road, owned and stewarded by LandPaths. The land is the ancestral territory of the Southern Pomo people and the Coast Miwok people since time memorial. The land teems with native coastal grasslands, canyons, ponds and streams, mixed oak woodlands, redwoods, and a habitat garden that benefits pollinators, birds, and humans alike. Learn more about Ocean Song here.
 
Where to Meet: We will meet in the parking area just outside the habitat garden in front of the large red-roofed barn. 
 
Directions: From the town of Occidental, head west on Coleman Valley Rd for 1.8 Miles. Turn right to remain on Coleman Valley Rd and continue an additional 3.4 miles to the main entrance to the preserve (19100 Coleman Valley Road), which will be on your left. Look for the LandPaths' sign in the driveway. Staff or volunteers will direct you towards the barn and parking area. NOTE THAT THE ADDRESSES ARE NOT ALWAYS IN NUMERICAL ORDER ON COLEMAN VALLEY ROAD.

Drawing more than 5,000 community members each year, the event has become a Sonoma County tradition. The Fiesta is a community-wide celebration of cultures, people, and traditions that also increases awareness about Hispanic history and tradition, service organizations that support our community, and the many Latinx businesses in Sonoma County.

                        <p>*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* returns to di Rosa with *Twelfth Night*, a romantic comedy of mistaken identity, set against the backdrop of di Rosa's stunning artwork and natural beauty. Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night* centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who become embroiled in a love triangle with the Duke Orsino, Countess Olivia, and each other. The story plays off gender confusion and mistaken identity to raise social critique, all served with a lot of laughs.

For *Shakespeare Summer Stroll*, SNV presents an abridged version directed by Jennifer King, and with live musical accompaniment arranged by music director Dr. Christina Howell. Audiences will follow a guided walking tour through the plot points of *Twelfth Night*, all set against the incredible artwork and natural backdrop of di Rosa. The production will feature award-winning Bay Area actor Tim Kniffin in the role of Malvolio, along with local professionals Matthew Cowell, Olivia Cowell, and Rio Codda working alongside apprentice actors from Napa Valley College.  

*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* is made possible in part by a Collaborative Arts and Culture Grant from the County of Napa Board of Supervisors.

A Raven original.

Two German officers are billeted at the home of a Jewish family on the outskirts of Paris in 1940. One officer is drawn to the woman of the house, and she to him in this moving, star-crossed love story that explores the human struggles in a world at war.

"At the beginning of the German occupation of Paris in 1940, my Jewish grandmother and a German officer who was billeted in her home crossed the boundaries set by the war. I wanted to tell their very human story, set against the inhumanity of war.” - Francine Schwartz

                        <p>**Latin Hits! Rhythm! Nostalgia! Romance! ¡Un apasionante viaje musical por la música y la cultura latina!**

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Descubren que todos comparten el nombre popular José, pero raíces diversas; puertorriqueña, cubana, mexicana y dominicana. Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

**Dawn & Michael & Tony**

A North Bay-based trio, Dawn Angelosante, Michael Fecskes & Tony Gibson perform a dreamscape of song that is intimate and haunting. Their acoustic-laden, stripped-down sound of lush vocal harmonies paired with piano, cello and guitar can hold a familiarity like an old friend. And like an old friend, experiencing their performance sends audiences home with a sense of comfort. For fans of Watchhouse

**Sativa January** - Singer-songwriter Sativa January and vocalist Victoria Raybourn play lush harmony-driven indie dream-folk songs in the San Francisco Bay Area, performing together as Sativa January. In March of 2023, the duo released their first single, “Lightning and Fire,” with Tricia Lewis on cello. Sativa January is working on an album entitled Blood Essential, which depicts a journey of triumph through the wreckage of emotional and societal upheaval. Striking vulnerability and propulsive hooks in these twelve songs remind listeners of The Cranberries, Mazzy Star, Cat Power, and First Aid Kit.

                        <p>*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* returns to di Rosa with *Twelfth Night*, a romantic comedy of mistaken identity, set against the backdrop of di Rosa's stunning artwork and natural beauty. Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night* centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who become embroiled in a love triangle with the Duke Orsino, Countess Olivia, and each other. The story plays off gender confusion and mistaken identity to raise social critique, all served with a lot of laughs.

For *Shakespeare Summer Stroll*, SNV presents an abridged version directed by Jennifer King, and with live musical accompaniment arranged by music director Dr. Christina Howell. Audiences will follow a guided walking tour through the plot points of *Twelfth Night*, all set against the incredible artwork and natural backdrop of di Rosa. The production will feature award-winning Bay Area actor Tim Kniffin in the role of Malvolio, along with local professionals Matthew Cowell, Olivia Cowell, and Rio Codda working alongside apprentice actors from Napa Valley College.  

*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* is made possible in part by a Collaborative Arts and Culture Grant from the County of Napa Board of Supervisors.

These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

Upstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm **www.upstairsartgallery.net**

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

Upstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm **www.upstairsartgallery.net**

                        <p>oin us in our most dreamy location yet in the middle of a blooming lavender labyrinth at sunset! This Season we have added one Sunday a month besides our weekly events. Sunday June 17 at 5pm is our Father's Day Sound Bath Experience with Special Guest Master Sound Healer James Fern. We are thrilled to share this magic with you! Let the fragrance of lavender fill and sooth your senses as the sound expands your awareness. 

Sound baths create the space for self-healing and transformation. The resonance of the instruments is not just an auditory experience ~ its like receiving a full body sound massage. There will be 7 Gongs, Crystal singing bowls, Hand pan, Mono chord, Chimes galore, Ocean drum, Native drum, Sansula, Shamanic Vocals & more. The vibrations will transport you on a magical journey!

The sound bath starts promptly at 7pm (except Sundays). Gates close at 6:50 PM. Please be Mindful of timing. You will need time to park and set up and you are welcome to come walk the labyrinth and visit the Farm Stand from 6pm onward. 

You will be lying on the grass, so please bring all that you will need to feel cozy, a pillow, eye mask, yoga mat or camping pad, blanket/sleeping bag and water bottle. Wonderful Lavender Eye Masks will be available to purchase for $22 by the Bees & Blooms Farm Stand.

Please be informed that there are bee hives on site and there may be bees on the lavender plants. If you are allergic to bee stings, bring your Epipen. An incident is unlikely, but best to be prepared. Also, at some point, probably mid July the Lavender will began to be harvested so there may be less lavender towards the end of the month.

Full Bloom occurs in June.

The last sound bath of the Lavender season will be Sept 25th. The labyrinth & farm will be beautiful however the Lavender will be reaching the end of its cycle around mid. July.

Only service animals & please and no children under 13 years of age.

Labyrinths represent a metaphor for your life path and the journey you are making. While walking the path of the labyrinth, either alone or with a group, focus on your feelings and emotions to allow you to connect with yourself. You may also want to choose a meditation that you are comfortable with in order to clear and quiet your mind. The uses of a labyrinth are many; relief from stress and anxiety, healing, meditation, problem solving, enhancing intuition, expanding thought processes, communicating with the Divine, balancing mind, body and spirit, letting go of unwanted energies, obtaining goals, celebrating and remembering others, building trust in yourself or others, and coping with grief, sorrow and loss. The labyrinth is an ancient symbol that relates to wholeness. It combines the imagery of the circle and the spiral into a meandering but purposeful path. The Labyrinth represents a journey to our own center and back again out into the world. Labyrinths have long been used as meditation and prayer tools.

Looking forward to this Extraordinary Experience with you!

In Gratitude</p>

Kick off your day with the healthy practice of yoga! Yoga strengthens immunity, improves circulation, and provides a sense of calm to take throughout your day. Krissy teaches a flowing style of Hatha yoga which integrates solar or strengthening poses with lunar or restorative poses. Her teaching style is lighthearted and filled with alignment cues and breath work. This class is geared towards beginners, improvers and intermediate but all levels will receive the benefit of a morning practice. 

You may bring your own mats or props but we do have mats, blocks and blankets available to use.

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when registering or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios.

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

Kevin Hutchinson & Friends - Every Tuesday!
Coming from the tradition of folk music, Kevin Hutchinson is a musical storyteller. His influences and styles cover many genres: folk, folk rock, blues, rock, rockabilly, Americana, country, swing, and, of course, folk. His music is lyric driven, and spans topics from love to social commentary, serious to light hearted.
Kevin loves connecting with the audience with his originals and thoughtful covers of artists that have inspired him, often pulling from their lesser known material.
Artistic influences, covering decades, include: John Prine; Bob Dylan; Bruce Cockburn; Warren Zevon; Crosby, Stills and Nash; Peter, Paul and Mary; Robert Earl Keen; Tom Russel; Tom Paxton; Paul Thorne; and many more.

This group is more than one individual and is held by volunteers, if you are interested please contact through the information below.

Art therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no matter what we are going through in life, we still have the ability to create and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into therapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going on internally. In that way, we can come back to pieces that represent specific times in our life!

- sonni king

We all need means of expression and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible way to heal.

There are so many things and burdens we carry in life, and not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a space where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating something is beautiful, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we learn about that feeling from a different perspective.

Art therapy will include art supplies, group grounding and group sharing, feel free to bring unfinished projects, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone who wants to volunteer their time, donate, guide the group, or have any questions should contact me here:

707-396-9318

Or contact Arlene Francis center

Thank you so much and I'm very excited to continue the gatherings that Sonni originally created.

                        <p>West County Fiddle Workshop \(every 3rd Tuesday from 7-9 PM\) In this 2-hour workshop, we'll dive into a new fiddle tune every month. American traditional fiddle music is vast, with deep Celtic roots and a fascinating multi-cultural history that gave birth to old-time music, and later to bluegrass. Each month, we'll work on a new tune from one of these three genres. After learning the basic melody, we'll explore the nuances that make each tune & style come alive. All stringed instruments and levels are welcome, but students should be comfortable enough on their instruments that they can learn bite-sized phrases of a melody by ear.  David Pascoe is a singer and multi-instrumentalist based in Occidental, CA. In addition to being a passionate music educator and the co-founder of Every Folk \(a 3-day camp for adults to explore traditional music and culture\), he performs with multiple groups up and down the West Coast on fiddle, mandolin, and guitar. He lives for the moment when music comes alive in the people around him. Workshop fee is $25, $20 for OCA members.  Register</p>

                        <p>PETALUMA --

Copperfield’s Books is honored to welcome Nemonte Nenquimo and Mitch Anderson to Petaluma for the launch of their impassioned memoir - We Will Be Jaguars: A Memoir of My People.

The discussion will be followed by a Q&A and book signing.

This is a free event, registration recommended.

From a fearless, internationally acclaimed activist comes an impassioned memoir about an indigenous childhood, a clash of cultures, and the fight to save the Amazon rainforest   We Will Be Jaguars is an astonishing memoir by an equally astonishing woman. Nenquimo is a winner of TIME magazine’s Earth Award, and MS. magazine named this book among the Most Anticipated Feminist Books of 2024.

Born into the Waorani tribe of Ecuador’s Amazon rainforest—one of the last to be contacted by missionaries in the 1950s—Nemonte Nenquimo had a singular upbringing.  

She was taught about plant medicines, foraging, oral storytelling, and shamanism by her elders. At age fourteen, she left the forest for the first time to study with an evangelical missionary group in the city. Eventually, her ancestors began appearing in her dreams, pleading with her to return and embrace her own culture. She listened.

Two decades later, Nemonte has emerged as one of the most forceful voices in climate change activism. She has spearheaded the alliance of indigenous nations across the Upper Amazon and led her people to a landmark victory against Big Oil, protecting over a half million acres of primary rainforest. Her message is as sharp as a spear—honed by her experiences battling loggers, miners, oil companies and missionaries.  

In We Will Be Jaguars, she partners with her husband, Mitch Anderson, founder of Amazon Frontlines, digging into generations of oral history, uprooting centuries of conquest, hacking away at racist notions of indigenous peoples, and ultimately revealing a life story as rich, harsh, and vital as the Amazon rainforest herself.

Authors: Nemonte Nenquimo, a Waorani leader, was born in Ecuador's Amazon, one of the most bio-diverse and threatened rainforests on the planet. She is the co-founder of both the Indigenous-led non-profit Ceibo Alliance and its partner organization, Amazon Frontlines. Nemonte led her people in an historic legal victory against the oil industry, protecting half a million acres of rainforest and setting a precedent for Indigenous rights across the region. Her leadership has been widely recognized; in 2020, she won the Goldman Environmental Prize for Central and South America and was named in the BBC’s 100 Women list and the TIME list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.   

Mitch Anderson is co-founder and Executive Director of Amazon Frontlines, a non-profit organization based in the Upper Amazon, which defends Indigenous peoples' rights to land, life, and cultural survival. In 2011, he moved to Ecuador's northern Amazon to start a grassroots clean water project with Indigenous communities living downriver from contaminating oil operations. Through building more than 1,000 clean water systems in over 70 villages, Mitch supported the formation of the Ceibo Alliance, an Indigenous-led non-profit that won the prestigious UN Equator Prize and whose victories for the Amazon rainforest have inspired millions worldwide.

These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

Here's what you need to know:

All volunteers, including children, must register individually before their volunteer shift

Volunteers under the age of 18 must have a guardian present. If volunteering without a guardian, prior approval is needed from both the guardian and Redwood Empire Food Bank staff.

For essential information about volunteering and answers to common questions from our volunteers about what to expect, we require all volunteers to read our Volunteer Handbook. 

Respect, fairness, and kindness are essential. Negative remarks or harassment will not be tolerated. Civil Rights training is required for volunteers aged 18\+

Expect to lift 15-35 lbs and be on your feet throughout the entire shift.

Speak to your Site Coordinator if you need food assistance.

Tech-savvy? Consider assisting with W5 sign-in support.

Distribution Site Safety:

Please arrive at your volunteer shift on time and report to the Site Coordinator. Staff will go over safety and assign duties at the beginning of the shift. 

This is a drive-thru distribution, so be prepared to load cars with food and with all aspects of the food distribution, from set-up to clean-up.

Dress brightly or wear a safety vest, wear closed-toed shoes, bring water, and dress in layers.

Thank you for helping us provide nutritious food to 142,000 individuals. Our priority is to feed the community and offer a great volunteering experience. For inquiries, please contact \(707\) 523-7900. This volunteer opportunity is located at

This session is for those who already know how to center and throw pieces successfully!

In addition to throwing, surface decoration techniques will be explored as well as the opportunity to experiment with different clay bodies.  Sonoma Ceramics is excited to roll out new sliding scale, accessible pricing for our classes. With this new payment option, materials for the course are now included in the price of the class. Course price includes a single 25 lb. bag of clay, and glazing and firing for said clay. Additional bags of clay can be purchased through the studio and/or office.

With your 8 week class registration, students receive the opportunity to purchase a studio pass for ½ off during the duration of their class. Sign ups for membership will be included in your preclass email.

Learn the basics of machine sewing during this four-session class especially for beginners. Everyone will design and sew their own reversible tote bag. Bring your own sewing machine or use one from our studio. All materials are provided.

Week 1: Learn about the machine – what everything is called and how it works. Then jump right in and practice sewing straight and curved lines.

Week 2: Become more familiar with threading your machine, winding the bobbin, and changing stitches. Learn about interfacing and how to use a pattern. Begin designing your tote bag by choosing fabric for the interior, exterior, and handles.

Week 3: Start cutting and sewing your project. Learn about pinning, seam allowances, pressing seams, and clipping corners.

Week 4: Complete your bag by assembling the parts and adding a row of topstitching. You’ll be proud of all you’ve learned and have the confidence to begin sewing clothes, home decor, quilts, toys, and more!

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

                        <p>It's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

This garden makes extensive use of stone, water and deer resistant plants to express the tranquil feeling of a Japanese style design.
Visitors will be treated to an in-depth look at the underlying Zen themes built into the rock arrangements and pond layout, as well as information about the planting themes and plant materials. The garden has been built over a period of many years and was designed by the preeminent Japanese landscape designer, Robert Ketchell, of Britain. The garden was built by the late Steve Stucky, landscaper and Zen Priest.</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm.

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm.

This seven-week studio course focuses on the fundamentals of drawing while exploring a variety of media, techniques, and subject matter from still life and landscape to the figure. We will use traditional and experimental approaches to drawing; students will develop an understanding of line, value, gesture, proportion, and form. Through demonstration, practice, and class discussion, participants hone the verbal and analytical skills necessary to critically examine their and others’ work. This course is appropriate for beginners and those wishing to further develop their drawing skills.

Please bring the following materials: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \(Char-kole brand black\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\).

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

Sarah Baker is a "blue-eyed soul" singer, songwriter, composer and pianist who has landed international radio airplay and performed on concert stages with legendary artists ranging from Etta James to Tom Petty.

The Northern California artist performs soul-blues music with a rock edge, offering hints of Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, and Susan Tedeschi. Her vocals have been described as soaring, gritty, tantalizing and unforgettable. Her songs, instrumentals and lyrics reflect the soulful heartbeat of Memphis and Muscle Shoals, the Southern vibe of Nashville, and the rock 'n' roll free spirit of Woodstock.

Sarah grew up surrounded by gospel, blues, country, bluegrass and rock 'n' roll in a West Tennessee working class family. She began piano lessons at age 6, often accompanying her father to country churches for all-day singings. She studied briefly after college at University of Memphis, moonlighting at Beale Street clubs, and absorbing the influence of Stax and Sam Phillips.

She later performed in New Mexico with the theater troupe The Kaleidoscope Players, the band Mother Fox, and a group mentored by actor Dennis Hopper called Dolly and The Lama Mountain Boys. She signed briefly with London Records before launching a successful career as a solo independent artist.

Cuts from her "Sarah Baker" album have received extensive radio airplay around the world, climbing various Gavin record charts. Her Zydeco tune "Use It Or Lose It" climbed into the top-five in southern Louisiana. Sarah's newly released album, "Baker's Dozen,” her third, includes blues rock swagger tune, “Revolving Door Man,” and the empowering rhythm ballad "Build That Bridge.”

She has performed at noted venues including the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, the Portland Blues Festival, and the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

Sarah has expanded into film and television by composing music for “I Married the War," a documentary about the spouses of combat veterans, and is working on a memoir.

**Sarah Baker** is a "blue-eyed soul" singer, songwriter, composer and pianist who has landed international radio airplay and performed on concert stages with legendary artists ranging from Etta James to Tom Petty.

The Northern California artist performs soul-blues music with a rock edge, offering hints of Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, and Susan Tedeschi. Her vocals have been described as soaring, gritty, tantalizing and unforgettable. Her songs, instrumentals and lyrics reflect the soulful heartbeat of Memphis and Muscle Shoals, the Southern vibe of Nashville, and the rock 'n' roll free spirit of Woodstock.

Sarah grew up surrounded by gospel, blues, country, bluegrass and rock 'n' roll in a West Tennessee working class family. She began piano lessons at age 6, often accompanying her father to country churches for all-day singings. She studied briefly after college at University of Memphis, moonlighting at Beale Street clubs, and absorbing the influence of Stax and Sam Phillips.

She later performed in New Mexico with the theater troupe The Kaleidoscope Players, the band Mother Fox, and a group mentored by actor Dennis Hopper called Dolly and The Lama Mountain Boys. She signed briefly with London Records before launching a successful career as a solo independent artist.

Cuts from her "Sarah Baker" album have received extensive radio airplay around the world, climbing various Gavin record charts. Her Zydeco tune "Use It Or Lose It" climbed into the top-five in southern Louisiana. Sarah's newly released album, "Baker's Dozen,” her third, includes blues rock swagger tune, “Revolving Door Man,” and the empowering rhythm ballad "Build That Bridge.”

She has performed at noted venues including the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, the Portland Blues Festival, and the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

Sarah has expanded into film and television by composing music for “I Married the War," a documentary about the spouses of combat veterans, and is working on a memoir.

                        <p>*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* returns to di Rosa with *Twelfth Night*, a romantic comedy of mistaken identity, set against the backdrop of di Rosa's stunning artwork and natural beauty. Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night* centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who become embroiled in a love triangle with the Duke Orsino, Countess Olivia, and each other. The story plays off gender confusion and mistaken identity to raise social critique, all served with a lot of laughs.

For *Shakespeare Summer Stroll*, SNV presents an abridged version directed by Jennifer King, and with live musical accompaniment arranged by music director Dr. Christina Howell. Audiences will follow a guided walking tour through the plot points of *Twelfth Night*, all set against the incredible artwork and natural backdrop of di Rosa. The production will feature award-winning Bay Area actor Tim Kniffin in the role of Malvolio, along with local professionals Matthew Cowell, Olivia Cowell, and Rio Codda working alongside apprentice actors from Napa Valley College.  

*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* is made possible in part by a Collaborative Arts and Culture Grant from the County of Napa Board of Supervisors.

                        <p>**Latin Hits! Rhythm! Nostalgia! Romance! ¡Un apasionante viaje musical por la música y la cultura latina!**

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Hace mucho frío en Omaha, pero las cosas se calientan cuando cuatro jóvenes se encuentran en Burrito World. Descubren que todos comparten el nombre popular José, pero raíces diversas; puertorriqueña, cubana, mexicana y dominicana. Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

Stanroy Music Center Presents Song Service, an intimate evening with three artists passing the spotlight. Expect insights into the craft of the song from inspiration to final form.

Musician and producer **Brindl**’s music is soulful folk-nouveau: a unique blend of singer-songwriter folk, soul, and blues. Brindl’s roots run deep in the North Bay music community — growing up in West Marin and now calling Sonoma County her home — her poetic songwriting reflects her connection to Northern California’s natural beauty and bohemian culture. Brindl has released three full length albums independently on her Moxy Music label, toured the West Coast*,* and has been featured on KRSH and Folk Alley.

Fronted by multi-instrumentalist Chris Olney-Burnett, '**Olney**' started as an acoustic project during the COVID lockdowns. It's influenced by a wide variety of musical styles ranging from Americana, folk, country-western, 'django-jazz', ragtime, delta blues, Indie folk and folk/traditional music from around the world. Although influenced by all these styles, Olney strives to be not pigeonholed by any one of them and to make, write, and cover music that just comes naturally.

**Thomas Beebout** loves music dearly and hopes to continuously use it to translate his experience sensations and fears with personalized sounds and genuine lyrics. He plays piano and sings and though he hopes not to be a single genre he is strongly influenced by music such as classic rock, jazz, and modern indie with styles from other countries aswell. His music moves him and he hopes it will move others.

Stanroy Music Center - located at 850 4th Street in Downtown Santa Rosa celebrates it's 76th anniversary this year.

They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

Do you struggle to mix the exact colors you envision in your oil paintings?

This in-person course is designed for artists like you, who want to build a strong foundation in color mixing with oil paints. Over eight, 3-hour weekly sessions, you’ll gain the knowledge and skills to confidently create a full spectrum palette tailored to your unique artistic vision.

Through a combination of hands-on practice, engaging discussions, live demonstrations, and comprehensive handouts, you’ll:

Master the fundamentals of color theory, including the color wheel, primary and secondary colors, and color relationships.

Explore the unique characteristics of oil paints and how they influence color mixing.

Develop your ability to create a vast range of colors through precise mixing techniques.

Learn how to achieve subtle variations in hue, saturation, and value.

Gain the confidence to mix any color you need for your paintings.

Discover how to personalize your palette to best suit your artistic style.

This course provides a progressive learning experience, building your skills week by week. By the end, you’ll be equipped to confidently mix vibrant, harmonious colors that elevate your oil paintings to the next level. This is not a class where students will be making paintings; we will explore color mixing with oils and learn how to develop working palettes along with some basic color science for understanding.

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

                        <p>Guide Dogs for the Blind (GDB) offers walking tours of its California campus in San Rafael, to give visitors the opportunity to learn about and observe the training and nurturing required to help these puppies on their journey to become guide dogs for people who are blind or visually impaired. Daily tours can accommodate up to 36 people, and reservations are required at least a week in advance.

The tours, which last a little more than an hour, include a stop at the Learning Lab in GDB’s state-of-the art Puppy Center, where all GDB puppies will spend the first critical eight to 10 weeks of life. The Puppy Center also includes areas for puppy birthing and puppy socialization. The Learning Lab is an educational center to expand the public’s understanding of what it takes to make a successful guide dog. While the Learning Lab stop is educational, it’s been known to melt even the most cynical heart, with its views of puppies playing, rolling, running, and mugging for selfies. The tour also includes outdoor stops in the training courtyard and the residential courtyard, where visitors learn about training and other aspects of GDB’s three programs: Guide Dog Mobility Program, Orientation and Mobility (O&M) Program, and K9 Buddy Program. Visit GDB tours for more information and to book your tour. 

Tours run Mondays through Fridays at 10 am, July 1 through December 30, 2024.

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

                        <p>*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* returns to di Rosa with *Twelfth Night*, a romantic comedy of mistaken identity, set against the backdrop of di Rosa's stunning artwork and natural beauty. Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night* centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who become embroiled in a love triangle with the Duke Orsino, Countess Olivia, and each other. The story plays off gender confusion and mistaken identity to raise social critique, all served with a lot of laughs.

For *Shakespeare Summer Stroll*, SNV presents an abridged version directed by Jennifer King, and with live musical accompaniment arranged by music director Dr. Christina Howell. Audiences will follow a guided walking tour through the plot points of *Twelfth Night*, all set against the incredible artwork and natural backdrop of di Rosa. The production will feature award-winning Bay Area actor Tim Kniffin in the role of Malvolio, along with local professionals Matthew Cowell, Olivia Cowell, and Rio Codda working alongside apprentice actors from Napa Valley College.  

*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* is made possible in part by a Collaborative Arts and Culture Grant from the County of Napa Board of Supervisors.

                        <p>**Latin Hits! Rhythm! Nostalgia! Romance! ¡Un apasionante viaje musical por la música y la cultura latina!**

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

Hace mucho frío en Omaha, pero las cosas se calientan cuando cuatro jóvenes se encuentran en Burrito World. Descubren que todos comparten el nombre popular José, pero raíces diversas; puertorriqueña, cubana, mexicana y dominicana. Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

                        <p>It's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

                        <p>Christopher Hampton's translation of the award-winning comedy by Yasmina Reza. Two couples meet to discuss a fight between their young sons. Things rapidly and uproariously take a turn for the worse, and that's BEFORE they break out the rum. Speaks to our deeply divided society, where identity politics and tribalism have superseded civility and kindness. Adult language and themes of racism, sexism, and homophobia.</p>

                        <p>We are taking part in The Michael J. Fox Foundation's 2024 Tour de Fox Wine Country Ride to support Parkinson's research.    More than 6 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson’s disease \(PD\) — the second most common neurological disorder. Currently, there is no known cure for Parkinson’s. As the world’s largest nonprofit funder of PD research, MJFF is working to change this. MJFF is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today.    Your gift will make a real difference: 100 percent of proceeds to the Tour de Fox go directly into researcher's hands to advance more targeted treatments, earlier intervention, and ultimately a cure for Parkinson's.   Help us move a cure for Parkinson's disease over the finish line by making a donation today.

Thank you for your support!</p>

                        <p>After the October 2017 Nuns Fire and the October 2020 Glass Fire burned 70-85% of Sugarloaf, it took months of hard work to repair trails and facilities. Now, almost 4 years after the Glass Fire, signs of the devastation are masked by a vibrant recovery and renewal.

Join Naturalist John Lynch on this 3.5-mile, 2.5-hour hike along the Lower Bald Mountain hillside to the Observatory and back along the shady creekside to explore these remarkable changes and talk a little about how the original peoples of this area used fire. We will also search for late summer wildflowers, butterflies and dragonflies.

Meet outside the Visitor Center. Bring at least a quart of water, layered clothing, hiking shoes/boots, snack, sun protection, and as an option, hiking poles and/or a camera. Parking fees apply.</p>

                        <p>Russian Riverkeeper is pleased to announce the exciting plans we have in store for the 38th Annual Russian River Watershed Cleanup on Saturday, September 21st, 2024!  We’re looking forward to gathering again with you to show the river some love and care when the summer comes to a close. The September cleanup is our largest of the year and helps remove trash that accumulates over the summer months on the Russian River. This year, there will be teams across the watershed from Ukiah to Monte Rio all contributing with the shared mission of protecting our River and ocean from trash pollution. Our goal in 2024 is to beat our record in 2023 when 468 volunteers collected over four tons of trash and 92 tires- and we can only do it with your help. 

Sign up for a volunteer cleanup event starting August 1st and help us beat our record! Sign up at: www.russianriverkeeper.org/rrwcu

These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

We typically ride on the third or fourth weekend of the month. Bring your road-ready bicycle, helmet, water, a spare tube, patch kit, mini pump, ID and some cash for lunch.

What to Expect on Our Rides

    We offer routes of various distances and paces.

        Gateway: 8-10 miles. Great for beginners or those just wanting a shorter ride.
        Easy Does It: 15-20 miles, 10-12 mph.
        In the Groove: 25-30 miles, 11-15 mph.
        Pick Up the Pace: 25-30 miles (same route as In the Groove), 14-17 mph.
        Going for It: 40-50 miles. Our newest ride, featuring longer distances and bigger Sonoma County climbs!

No Chick is left behind! All paces are welcome, and all routes have leaders and sweeps to support you on the way. We always start off together and regroup many times throughout the ride.

We ride throughout Sonoma County from different locations. Routes are based on terrain, road safety and projected weather conditions. We usually stop at a restaurant or farmers market for an optional group lunch or drink.

Rain cancels the ride.

Petaluma has a unique and fascinating history as a bustling river town during and after the Gold Rush, then as the “Chicken and Egg Capital of the World,” and now as a town that loves its history. Learn about Petaluma’s incredible architecture (including 8 sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and other important and interesting facets of our town’s history. You’ll be informed by your docent’s historical knowledge and entertained by their characters’ stories.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

                        <p>It's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to toast their mentor Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a vicious fight to be understood. On a chilly night in the middle of America, this haunting play offers grace and disarming clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself.

                        <p>**Latin Hits! Rhythm! Nostalgia! Romance! ¡Un apasionante viaje musical por la música y la cultura latina!**

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Hace mucho frío en Omaha, pero las cosas se calientan cuando cuatro jóvenes se encuentran en Burrito World. Descubren que todos comparten el nombre popular José, pero raíces diversas; puertorriqueña, cubana, mexicana y dominicana. Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

Join us as we embark on a unique journey downstream on a huge outgoing tide, pedaling high-quality Hobie pedal kayaks, leaving your hands free for hydration and birdwatching (don’t forget your binoculars!). We’ll cruise into the early September evening, soaking up the beautiful expanding views of the river as we make our way to Gilardi's Lakeville Marina.

At the marina, we’ll be treated to a special collaboration with the newest hotspot in town: Sundrop Sauna. Their serene riverside setup offers the perfect blend of relaxation and natural beauty. Enjoy the sauna and unwind as the sun sets, with nosh and beverages to complement the experience.

**Note:** You’ll need a bathing suit and towel for the sauna. There are restrooms, a changing tent, and a natural-temperature shower available. Either leave them in a car at the marina before heading to The Floathouse for the experience, or bring them with you in the boat.</p>

The Gualala Arts Chamber Music Series is set to present a captivating concert titled “Eric Kritz and Friends” on Saturday, September 21 at 4 pm. This ensemble features the talents of Eric Kritz on clarinet, with Paul Brancato, Marcia Lotter, and Susan Freier on violin, Stephen Harrison on cello, and Carolyn Steinbuck on piano. The program promises a rich tapestry of sounds, opening with the vibrant “Disco Toccata for Clarinet & Cello” by Guillaume Connesson, followed by the emotive “Sonata for Clarinet & Piano, FP 184” by Francis Poulenc, movements from the deeply reflective Allegro Tristamente to the spirited Allegro con Fuoco. The first half concludes with Peter Schickele’s “Quartet for Clarinet, Violin, Cello & Piano,” a piece that promises to take the audience through a range of emotions and rhythms. After the intermission, the grandeur of C. M. von Weber’s “Grand Quintet, Op.34” for Clarinet and String Quartet will be on full display, featuring movements that range from the exuberant Allegro to the whimsical Menuetto capriccio. This special event offers tickets at $25 in advance, with a $5 increase on the day of the concert, available at the Dolphin Gallery, Gualala Arts, and online.

                        <p>*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* returns to di Rosa with *Twelfth Night*, a romantic comedy of mistaken identity, set against the backdrop of di Rosa's stunning artwork and natural beauty. Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night* centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who become embroiled in a love triangle with the Duke Orsino, Countess Olivia, and each other. The story plays off gender confusion and mistaken identity to raise social critique, all served with a lot of laughs.

For *Shakespeare Summer Stroll*, SNV presents an abridged version directed by Jennifer King, and with live musical accompaniment arranged by music director Dr. Christina Howell. Audiences will follow a guided walking tour through the plot points of *Twelfth Night*, all set against the incredible artwork and natural backdrop of di Rosa. The production will feature award-winning Bay Area actor Tim Kniffin in the role of Malvolio, along with local professionals Matthew Cowell, Olivia Cowell, and Rio Codda working alongside apprentice actors from Napa Valley College.  

*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* is made possible in part by a Collaborative Arts and Culture Grant from the County of Napa Board of Supervisors.

                        <p>The first people started making stories from sitting around fires. Their evenings began to lengthen as they developed language to evoke their emotional events of the day. Stories became legends and myths, passed from culture to culture, country to country. 

Join me for a deep dive and exploration into myth. We will relive these myths and stories bringing deep awareness about who we are. Life’s initiations, rituals, trials, triumphs, and defeats are played out on the grand scale of hundreds of thousands of years. Discover your path of initiations and trials through the characters of antiquity. We will use timeless stories to infuse your daily life with meaning and understanding of how you have arrived on your current path.

Join me for this workshop to discover:

Your own myth
The trials you have mastered and the trials you have avoided
How you fit into your family and your relationships
Your next steps to being your authentic self

You will go home with a deeper...
Understanding of the metaphors that have shaped your life.
Sense of self and the power that comes with that understanding.
Connection to your loved ones and community at large.
Curiosity about life.

Your Ancestors are calling. “Maybe this is the one who will heal our family divisions, maybe this is the one who will bring truth, beauty, and love into our lives.” Your only step is to show up and sign up, NOW.

This is your time to answer the ancestors.

Sloan Irving Sloan Irving is a singer-songwriter based in Sonoma County, influenced largely by Americana, Folk, and Indie Rock music. She released her debut EP titled Rain on This Parade in February of 2023. Sloan plays a combination of covers of the songs she adores and her originals with melancholic soothing vocals and guitar that match the tone of her songs, often drawn from personal life experiences, and a wavering existentialism. Her influences include artists like Joni Mitchell, Phoebe Bridgers, and Brandi Carlile all of whom have writing styles which encapsulate the brutal honesty Sloan aspires to convey.

                        <p>Christopher Hampton's translation of the award-winning comedy by Yasmina Reza. Two couples meet to discuss a fight between their young sons. Things rapidly and uproariously take a turn for the worse, and that's BEFORE they break out the rum. Speaks to our deeply divided society, where identity politics and tribalism have superseded civility and kindness. Adult language and themes of racism, sexism, and homophobia.</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EFFECTS** 

EXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22, 2024

RECEPTION:   Saturday, September 7, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate the show.  Refreshments will be served.

**Sonoma County artist, Marsha Connell,** presents **Tidal Effects,** new oil paintings from observation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen and unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day this landscape of water, earth and air changes, as does the artist, and the viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction, shifting shape, color, edges, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrational forces - sand, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Looking down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water, taste the salt, smell the sea, the ocean pulsing, breathing, never resting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults, Rogers Creek and Mayacama, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins, keeping Santa Rosa, Ukiah, the Bay area, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solace and joy, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in this world of planetary crises.” 

Marsha Connell’s life as an artist/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Rosa Junior College’s Art Department, she also taught at Sonoma State University, California Arts Project, K-12 public and private schools, and numerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and the California Arts Council, Connell held leadership roles and participated for years in Art Trails Open Studios, Art at the Source, and this year’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collected at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.

Meet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and September 8, 11 am – 6 pm.

The Stairway Small Works Showcase presents **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**, a collection of watercolor and gouache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the artist’s attention.  From Carmel, to France to the Swiss Alps, no airline ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fishermen stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. 

Meet the Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 am to 6 pm. 

**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Gallery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident, she is inspired by its quintessential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses on flowers, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely colorful, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at the Gallery.

**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14, 5:30 – 7:30 pm** : The Upstairs Art Gallery is pleased to join other Healdsburg galleries in the Second Saturday Artwalk, featuring a dozen galleries surrounding the historic downtown plaza.

                        <p>*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* returns to di Rosa with *Twelfth Night*, a romantic comedy of mistaken identity, set against the backdrop of di Rosa's stunning artwork and natural beauty. Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night* centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who become embroiled in a love triangle with the Duke Orsino, Countess Olivia, and each other. The story plays off gender confusion and mistaken identity to raise social critique, all served with a lot of laughs.

For *Shakespeare Summer Stroll*, SNV presents an abridged version directed by Jennifer King, and with live musical accompaniment arranged by music director Dr. Christina Howell. Audiences will follow a guided walking tour through the plot points of *Twelfth Night*, all set against the incredible artwork and natural backdrop of di Rosa. The production will feature award-winning Bay Area actor Tim Kniffin in the role of Malvolio, along with local professionals Matthew Cowell, Olivia Cowell, and Rio Codda working alongside apprentice actors from Napa Valley College.  

*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* is made possible in part by a Collaborative Arts and Culture Grant from the County of Napa Board of Supervisors.

It’s freezing in Omaha, but things heat up when four young men meet at Burrito World. They discover they all share the popular name José, but diverse roots; Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican. Brought together by their name and a shared musical dream, they add some spice to their lives, stage a revue of the Latin hits they grew up with, and shatter Latino stereotypes.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.

This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. *Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María* spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Hace mucho frío en Omaha, pero las cosas se calientan cuando cuatro jóvenes se encuentran en Burrito World. Descubren que todos comparten el nombre popular José, pero raíces diversas; puertorriqueña, cubana, mexicana y dominicana. Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

Enter María, their stunning substitute singer who proves to be more than they imagined. The Josés trip over themselves and each other trying to win her with their charisma and talents. Their hilarious and heartfelt performance at the local VFW hall is an exuberant chaos of missed cues and playful conflicts.
This Off-Broadway Hit, originally produced by Enrique Iglesias, is performed in both Spanish and English. Four Guys Named José… And Una Mujer Named María spotlights electrifying Latin hits like “La Bamba,” “Guantanamera,” and “Bésame Mucho” in lush harmonies and electric rhythms. This show is a fun, vibrant, passionate musical journey through love, loss, and nostalgia.

Feel the heartbeat of this tribute to Latin music and culture. You’ll dance out of your seat and into the aisles!

Hace mucho frío en Omaha, pero las cosas se calientan cuando cuatro jóvenes se encuentran en Burrito World. Descubren que todos comparten el nombre popular José, pero raíces diversas; puertorriqueña, cubana, mexicana y dominicana. Unidos por su nombre y un sueño musical compartido, añaden algo de sabor a sus vidas, presentan una revista de los éxitos latinos con los que crecieron y rompen los estereotipos latinos.

Entra María, su impresionante cantante sustituta que demuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mismos y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su divertida y sentida actuación en la sala local de VFW es un caos exuberante de pistas perdidas y conflictos divertidos.

                        <p>*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* returns to di Rosa with *Twelfth Night*, a romantic comedy of mistaken identity, set against the backdrop of di Rosa's stunning artwork and natural beauty. Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night* centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who become embroiled in a love triangle with the Duke Orsino, Countess Olivia, and each other. The story plays off gender confusion and mistaken identity to raise social critique, all served with a lot of laughs.

For *Shakespeare Summer Stroll*, SNV presents an abridged version directed by Jennifer King, and with live musical accompaniment arranged by music director Dr. Christina Howell. Audiences will follow a guided walking tour through the plot points of *Twelfth Night*, all set against the incredible artwork and natural backdrop of di Rosa. The production will feature award-winning Bay Area actor Tim Kniffin in the role of Malvolio, along with local professionals Matthew Cowell, Olivia Cowell, and Rio Codda working alongside apprentice actors from Napa Valley College.  

*Shakespeare Summer Stroll* is made possible in part by a Collaborative Arts and Culture Grant from the County of Napa Board of Supervisors.

We are bringing the best professional club comedians in the State to Petaluma. We love you and want you to come experience professional comedians in your very own backyard while being able to spend your money on our amazing craft beer selection, our huge variety of amazing cocktails, including our Moscow Mule Menu!

$5 COVER CHARGE \(this would be a $30 dollar ticket anywhere else\)

We have gathered the top standup comedians who preform in clubs across California and the country and brought them to Petaluma to make you laugh harder then you ever have before in.

Your headliner Derek Sheen is a cuddly mess of insecurities and a gifted, one-of-a-kind storyteller. His ability to mine humor from the dark, humid corners of the human condition has made him a cult favorite of comedy nerds around the globe.

Despite a lack of television or film credits, he has amassed a pretty loyal fan base touring with comedy legends \(name-drop alert!\) Brian Posehn, Patton Oswalt and Janeane Garofalo.

Derek Sheen has released four critically acclaimed albums on Minneapolis based Stand Up! Records, with Grammy Winning producer Dan Schlissel.

All four albums are available for streaming on Spotify and Apple Music right now!

Tyler Hinz is a Bay area favorite and has racked up a fair amount of comedy credits. The 30-year-old South Bay standup known for his quirky digressions and keen, off-the-cuff observations—he's been compared to Rory Scovel—has opened for a number of high-profile comedians at Rooster T. Feathers and the San Jose Improv, including Darren Carter, Ron Shock and Marc Curry \(Hanging with Mr. Cooper\).

Austin Blaylock hails from the secret wine capitol of California, a small town called Livermore. He performs stand-up all over the Bay Area, but his favorite haunts are San Francisco and San Jose, as well as being featured in SF Sketchfest. He’s known for hosting and producing Super Stacked, a locally renowned comedy show in San Jose, that was featured in the San Jose Metro and Content Magazine. With a charming mix of self-deprecating and anecdotal humor, Austin has a natural gift for warming up a crowd, having opened for touring acts like Laurie Kilmartin. On a given day, you can find Austin working on comedy writing, jamming on his guitar \(he totally knows Wonderwall\), or hanging with his cat, Gus.

Loren Kraut is awkwardly hilarious, Loren’s unorthodox style of comedy juxtaposes playfulness with deeply dark humor. She turns grim subject matter, like depression and suicide, on its ear, presenting the bleakness of mental illness with unexpected wit and levity. Ever the outsider, Loren gives us a glimpse into her weird, silly and often tragic world that, in the end, is surprisingly life affirming.

Dvontre Coleman is a comedian based in San Francisco, CA. Growing up he moved a lot, but the one thing he took with him everywhere was the ability to laugh. Now he just does that in front of strangers with a microphone.

Mikel Nordstrom is a standup comic and producer based in the California Bay Area. He has performed at venues such as the Sacramento Punchline and Cobbs Comedy Club. Mikel has taken part in comedy festivals, most recently at the 2022 Savage Henrys Comedy Festival. His unique voice and perspective creates for a memorable show.</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

This class will introduce students to basic techniques of using soft pastels as they work alongside the instructor to create landscapes, still lifes, animals and flowers. Learn to layer colors to create luminous, painterly effects. Beginners are guided as they work on the image provided each week; more experienced students may choose to work on an image of their choice. No prior experience is required. Please see the supply list to learn what materials are needed for this class.

We are bringing the best professional club comedians in the State to Petaluma. We love you and want you to come experience professional comedians in your very own backyard while being able to spend your money on our amazing craft beer selection, our huge variety of amazing cocktails, including our Moscow Mule Menu!

$5 COVER CHARGE \(this would be a $30 dollar ticket anywhere else\)

We have gathered the top standup comedians who preform in clubs across California and the country and brought them to Petaluma to make you laugh harder then you ever have before in.

Your headliner Derek Sheen is a cuddly mess of insecurities and a gifted, one-of-a-kind storyteller. His ability to mine humor from the dark, humid corners of the human condition has made him a cult favorite of comedy nerds around the globe.

Despite a lack of television or film credits, he has amassed a pretty loyal fan base touring with comedy legends \(name-drop alert!\) Brian Posehn, Patton Oswalt and Janeane Garofalo.

Derek Sheen has released four critically acclaimed albums on Minneapolis based Stand Up! Records, with Grammy Winning producer Dan Schlissel.

All four albums are available for streaming on Spotify and Apple Music right now!

Tyler Hinz is a Bay area favorite and has racked up a fair amount of comedy credits. The 30-year-old South Bay standup known for his quirky digressions and keen, off-the-cuff observations—he's been compared to Rory Scovel—has opened for a number of high-profile comedians at Rooster T. Feathers and the San Jose Improv, including Darren Carter, Ron Shock and Marc Curry \(Hanging with Mr. Cooper\).

Austin Blaylock hails from the secret wine capitol of California, a small town called Livermore. He performs stand-up all over the Bay Area, but his favorite haunts are San Francisco and San Jose, as well as being featured in SF Sketchfest. He’s known for hosting and producing Super Stacked, a locally renowned comedy show in San Jose, that was featured in the San Jose Metro and Content Magazine. With a charming mix of self-deprecating and anecdotal humor, Austin has a natural gift for warming up a crowd, having opened for touring acts like Laurie Kilmartin. On a given day, you can find Austin working on comedy writing, jamming on his guitar \(he totally knows Wonderwall\), or hanging with his cat, Gus.

Loren Kraut is awkwardly hilarious, Loren’s unorthodox style of comedy juxtaposes playfulness with deeply dark humor. She turns grim subject matter, like depression and suicide, on its ear, presenting the bleakness of mental illness with unexpected wit and levity. Ever the outsider, Loren gives us a glimpse into her weird, silly and often tragic world that, in the end, is surprisingly life affirming.

Dvontre Coleman is a comedian based in San Francisco, CA. Growing up he moved a lot, but the one thing he took with him everywhere was the ability to laugh. Now he just does that in front of strangers with a microphone.

Mikel Nordstrom is a standup comic and producer based in the California Bay Area. He has performed at venues such as the Sacramento Punchline and Cobbs Comedy Club. Mikel has taken part in comedy festivals, most recently at the 2022 Savage Henrys Comedy Festival. His unique voice and perspective creates for a memorable show.</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

Kevin Hutchinson & Friends - Every Tuesday!
Coming from the tradition of folk music, Kevin Hutchinson is a musical storyteller. His influences and styles cover many genres: folk, folk rock, blues, rock, rockabilly, Americana, country, swing, and, of course, folk. His music is lyric driven, and spans topics from love to social commentary, serious to light hearted.
Kevin loves connecting with the audience with his originals and thoughtful covers of artists that have inspired him, often pulling from their lesser known material.
Artistic influences, covering decades, include: John Prine; Bob Dylan; Bruce Cockburn; Warren Zevon; Crosby, Stills and Nash; Peter, Paul and Mary; Robert Earl Keen; Tom Russel; Tom Paxton; Paul Thorne; and many more.

                        <p>Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experience needed, all are welcome!!

This group is more than one individual and is held by volunteers, if you are interested please contact through the information below.

Art therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no matter what we are going through in life, we still have the ability to create and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into therapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going on internally. In that way, we can come back to pieces that represent specific times in our life!

- sonni king

We all need means of expression and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible way to heal.

There are so many things and burdens we carry in life, and not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a space where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating something is beautiful, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we learn about that feeling from a different perspective.

Art therapy will include art supplies, group grounding and group sharing, feel free to bring unfinished projects, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone who wants to volunteer their time, donate, guide the group, or have any questions should contact me here:

707-396-9318

Or contact Arlene Francis center

Thank you so much and I'm very excited to continue the gatherings that Sonni originally created.

Amelia Day "A Girl, A Car, & A Guitar" West Coast Tour
Amelia Day is a queer folk rock powerhouse entering the conversation with mainstays like Melissa Etheridge, the Indigo Girls, and Brandi Carlile. Underscoring her carefree melodies with gritty, confessional lyricism and raw, heartfelt delivery, she performs with an intimacy that makes even new listeners feel familiar. Amelia mixes elements of her adolescent Seattle mixtapes of folk, rock, and jazz in music that plays freely with genre, while still being undeniably “Amelia Day". Without a label, manager, or agent, Amelia has sold out venues like Seattle’s iconic The Triple Door, been featured on popular stations like KEXP and 107.7 The End, played high-profile PNW festivals like Seattle PrideFest, Folklife, Bite of Seattle, and CHOMP!, and independently amassed over 3M streams and 90K monthly listeners on Spotify alone. Amelia Day released her sophomore EP "Little One" last November, which has been met with rave reviews from publications like the UW Daily and Outwrite and is currently hard at work on her next project!

Singer-songwriter Meli Levi (Mehl-Lee Lee-Vigh, they/she) has recently returned to music after a 5-year hiatus away studying meditation-based healing techniques with a master full-time. Today, they write with a reverence for the transformative capabilities of music; “A song can recall a powerful memory or inspire someone to forgive a person they’ve been upset with—music has that power—and I try to be aware of what I put out in the world with my songs”. Meli’s aesthetic has been best described as a mix of folk-rock and alt-rock with a splash of pop. Skillfully uniting boldness and delicacy across a rapidly expanding repertoire, singer/songwriter and guitarist Meli Levi is a gifted artist who has overcome adversity as a queer person to rise as one of the most exciting up and coming musical artists of our time.
Having shared stages with Brandi Carlile, Amy Ray (Indigo Girls), and Kathryn Calder (The New Pornographers), Meli's ability to enchant and engage a live audience is undeniable. Meli has earned acclaim from Seattle Sound Magazine, obtained exclusive music video premiers for their recent singles "Echo in a Valley" and "Close to You" in Glide Magazine and Under the Radar Magazine, was awarded second place in the Alternative category of the West Coast International Songwriters Competition, and was named one of KALW 91.7 FM 's "local favorites" for their NPR Music Tiny Desk Contest entry. Meli is currently back in the studio working on a full length album, set for release Spring 2025.

Crowded House

Tuesday, September 24, 2024, at 8:00pm

$75, $95, and $129

For more than four decades, Crowded House leader Neil Finn has been on an evolving, winding journey. Crowded House’s mid-‘80s hits like “Don’t Dream It’s Over” and “Something So Strong,” combined with albums like Woodface and Together Alone, set the standard for the period’s erudite jangle-pop while always pushing the band’s art forward. That creative spirit brings Finn and his Crowded House bandmates to Gravity Stairs, their first new release since 2021’s Dreamers Are Waiting and eighth overall. 

Produced by the band with Steven Schram, the album shows Crowded House in its current incarnation — Finn, Nick Seymour, Mitchell Froom, and Finn’s sons, Elroy and Liam — as sharp as ever, feeling musically adventurous and still capable of reaching the staggering highs that have made them an international favorite. 

Finn’s resume bears that out. From joining his brother Tim in the 80s artful pop band, Split Enz, to leading Crowded House to his numerous solo efforts, Finn’s varied body of work is connected by his knack for penning meticulous, indelible melodies and impressionistic lyrics that demand multiple listens. It’s earned him devoted fans all over the globe, an Order of the British Empire honor, and induction into the Australian Recording Industry Association’s Hall of Fame. 

All VIP packages purchased for Crowded House will go through a third-party website and will be managed by Please & Thank You. There will be no refunds or exchanges. VIP packages will not be sold or managed through the Luther Burbank Center for The Arts box office. You must have a seated ticket in order to enter the facility.

Reconnect with your inner nature as you experience outer nature. Forest Therapy, also known as Shinrin-yoku (Forest Bathing) connects you back to your senses and allows you to wake down into your body. Walk with Jen Borrow, certified Forest Therapy guide, and practice opening your senses and deepening your relationship with yourself, others and the natural world.

ABOUT JEN
Jen Borrow is a certified Forest Therapy guide through the Association for Nature and Forest Therapy with a Masters in Transpersonal Ecopsychology from Naropa University.
“Forest Therapy has deeply impacted me in mind, body and soul. I have witnessed first hand its impact on those I have guided. I cannot assume to know what medicine nature may have for someone during the walk. There is no prescribed outcome or a map for what “should” be experienced. Each person’s journey is unique. For me, Forest Therapy is a coming together of all that I have studied and learned over the years, into one practice. I am so honored to be able to offer this to others."</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

                        <p>Join us in supporting our community by participating in this drive-thru food distribution. Help distribute fresh produce, healthy groceries, and pantry staples to those in need. 

Here's what you need to know:

All volunteers, including children, must register individually before their volunteer shift

Volunteers under the age of 18 must have a guardian present. If volunteering without a guardian, prior approval is needed from both the guardian and Redwood Empire Food Bank staff.

For essential information about volunteering and answers to common questions from our volunteers about what to expect, we require all volunteers to read our Volunteer Handbook. 

Respect, fairness, and kindness are essential. Negative remarks or harassment will not be tolerated. Civil Rights training is required for volunteers aged 18\+

Expect to lift 15-35 lbs and be on your feet throughout the entire shift.

Speak to your Site Coordinator if you need food assistance.

Tech-savvy? Consider assisting with W5 sign-in support.

Distribution Site Safety:

Please arrive at your volunteer shift on time and report to the Site Coordinator. Staff will go over safety and assign duties at the beginning of the shift. 

This is a drive-thru distribution, so be prepared to load cars with food and with all aspects of the food distribution, from set-up to clean-up.

Dress brightly or wear a safety vest, wear closed-toed shoes, bring water, and dress in layers.

Thank you for helping us provide nutritious food to 142,000 individuals. Our priority is to feed the community and offer a great volunteering experience. For inquiries, please contact \(707\) 523-7900. This volunteer opportunity is located at

This session is for those who already know how to center and throw pieces successfully! A continuation of our all levels course, this intermediate level course will help you hone your throwing skills through more complex demos, and nuanced approaches to technical throwing. Expand your fundamentals and begin to develop your own voice in this 8 week course with Ben. In addition to throwing, surface decoration techniques will be explored as well as the opportunity to experiment with different clay bodies.  Sonoma Ceramics is excited to roll out new sliding scale, accessible pricing for our classes. With this new payment option, materials for the course are now included in the price of the class. Course price includes a single 25 lb. bag of clay, and glazing and firing for said clay. Additional bags of clay can be purchased through the studio and/or office.

With your 8 week class registration, students receive the opportunity to purchase a studio pass for ½ off during the duration of their class. Sign ups for membership will be included in your preclass email.

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

Learn the basics of machine sewing during this four-session class especially for beginners. Everyone will design and sew their own reversible tote bag. Bring your own sewing machine or use one from our studio. All materials are provided.

Week 1: Learn about the machine – what everything is called and how it works. Then jump right in and practice sewing straight and curved lines.

Week 2: Become more familiar with threading your machine, winding the bobbin, and changing stitches. Learn about interfacing and how to use a pattern. Begin designing your tote bag by choosing fabric for the interior, exterior, and handles.

Week 3: Start cutting and sewing your project. Learn about pinning, seam allowances, pressing seams, and clipping corners.

Week 4: Complete your bag by assembling the parts and adding a row of topstitching. You’ll be proud of all you’ve learned and have the confidence to begin sewing clothes, home decor, quilts, toys, and more!

State of the Latine Community Address


Location: Sonoma State University (Ballroom) | Address: 1801 E Cotati Ave, Rohnert Park, CA 94928


We are thrilled to host the 11th Annual State of the Latine Community Address (SOLCA) – a powerful gathering where community, conversation, and change intersect. This year, we’ll be unveiling the key findings from the Agenda For Action (AFA) report, a groundbreaking effort led by the Health Action Together group. This report goes beyond statistics, revealing the human stories behind the data and addressing the root causes of the disparities identified in the Portrait of Sonoma County 2021 Update.

This is more than just an event; it’s a movement. SOLCA is Los Cien’s largest and most eagerly awaited gathering of the year, drawing over 550 attendees from across our region to Sonoma State University. Together, we’ll engage in thought-provoking panels, hear from inspiring equity-focused keynotes, and explore actionable steps to drive positive change for our community.

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

This seven-week studio course focuses on the fundamentals of drawing while exploring a variety of media, techniques, and subject matter from still life and landscape to the figure. We will use traditional and experimental approaches to drawing; students will develop an understanding of line, value, gesture, proportion, and form. Through demonstration, practice, and class discussion, participants hone the verbal and analytical skills necessary to critically examine their and others’ work. This course is appropriate for beginners and those wishing to further develop their drawing skills.

Please bring the following materials: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \(Char-kole brand black\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\).

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.</p>

 We all move so quickly through life and rarely get the opportunity to celebrate the little wins and accomplishments.

We love having our community come together to Feast, have Fun and share their wins.

We appreciate everyone who walks through our doors and supports us and our program.

And we just keep getting better, with more space means bigger celebrations, any donations made toward the Celebrate Life BBQ will go into our next Celebration and into our SunnySide Update programming which you'll get a taste of at every BBQ moving forward!</p>

Sarah Baker is a "blue-eyed soul" singer, songwriter, composer and pianist who has landed international radio airplay and performed on concert stages with legendary artists ranging from Etta James to Tom Petty.

The Northern California artist performs soul-blues music with a rock edge, offering hints of Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, and Susan Tedeschi. Her vocals have been described as soaring, gritty, tantalizing and unforgettable. Her songs, instrumentals and lyrics reflect the soulful heartbeat of Memphis and Muscle Shoals, the Southern vibe of Nashville, and the rock 'n' roll free spirit of Woodstock.

Sarah grew up surrounded by gospel, blues, country, bluegrass and rock 'n' roll in a West Tennessee working class family. She began piano lessons at age 6, often accompanying her father to country churches for all-day singings. She studied briefly after college at University of Memphis, moonlighting at Beale Street clubs, and absorbing the influence of Stax and Sam Phillips.

She later performed in New Mexico with the theater troupe The Kaleidoscope Players, the band Mother Fox, and a group mentored by actor Dennis Hopper called Dolly and The Lama Mountain Boys. She signed briefly with London Records before launching a successful career as a solo independent artist.

Cuts from her "Sarah Baker" album have received extensive radio airplay around the world, climbing various Gavin record charts. Her Zydeco tune "Use It Or Lose It" climbed into the top-five in southern Louisiana. Sarah's newly released album, "Baker's Dozen,” her third, includes blues rock swagger tune, “Revolving Door Man,” and the empowering rhythm ballad "Build That Bridge.”

She has performed at noted venues including the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, the Portland Blues Festival, and the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

Sarah has expanded into film and television by composing music for “I Married the War," a documentary about the spouses of combat veterans, and is working on a memoir.

**Sarah Baker** is a "blue-eyed soul" singer, songwriter, composer and pianist who has landed international radio airplay and performed on concert stages with legendary artists ranging from Etta James to Tom Petty.

The Northern California artist performs soul-blues music with a rock edge, offering hints of Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, and Susan Tedeschi. Her vocals have been described as soaring, gritty, tantalizing and unforgettable. Her songs, instrumentals and lyrics reflect the soulful heartbeat of Memphis and Muscle Shoals, the Southern vibe of Nashville, and the rock 'n' roll free spirit of Woodstock.

Sarah grew up surrounded by gospel, blues, country, bluegrass and rock 'n' roll in a West Tennessee working class family. She began piano lessons at age 6, often accompanying her father to country churches for all-day singings. She studied briefly after college at University of Memphis, moonlighting at Beale Street clubs, and absorbing the influence of Stax and Sam Phillips.

She later performed in New Mexico with the theater troupe The Kaleidoscope Players, the band Mother Fox, and a group mentored by actor Dennis Hopper called Dolly and The Lama Mountain Boys. She signed briefly with London Records before launching a successful career as a solo independent artist.

Cuts from her "Sarah Baker" album have received extensive radio airplay around the world, climbing various Gavin record charts. Her Zydeco tune "Use It Or Lose It" climbed into the top-five in southern Louisiana. Sarah's newly released album, "Baker's Dozen,” her third, includes blues rock swagger tune, “Revolving Door Man,” and the empowering rhythm ballad "Build That Bridge.”

She has performed at noted venues including the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, the Portland Blues Festival, and the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

Sarah has expanded into film and television by composing music for “I Married the War," a documentary about the spouses of combat veterans, and is working on a memoir.

                        <p>Alexis Ginez is a Sonoma County tattoo artist.  He owns Dedicated Arte, a tattoo shop located in the City of Sonoma, and he specializes in black and grey realism.  Born in Mexico, he has been participating in tattoo festivals and conventions across the U.S. for many years, bringing home awards from shows hosted by the artists he admires.  Alexis will discuss the evolution of his unique style and how his art reflects his own story and the history of the local Latino community.

 

Isabel Lopez is the Executive Director of Raizes Collective, which empowers and mobilizes artists and educators of color in Sonoma County by providing resources and assistance for them to produce art within their own communities.  Raizes gives access to venues, events and various initiatives designed to cultivate local art with potential for social and political transformation.  Isabel will discuss how she founded Raizes when she saw "the need for people who look like me" and with whom she "shares lived experiences and values" to have a common space to build and create together.

Do you struggle to mix the exact colors you envision in your oil paintings?

This in-person course is designed for artists like you, who want to build a strong foundation in color mixing with oil paints. Over eight, 3-hour weekly sessions, you’ll gain the knowledge and skills to confidently create a full spectrum palette tailored to your unique artistic vision.

Through a combination of hands-on practice, engaging discussions, live demonstrations, and comprehensive handouts, you’ll:

Master the fundamentals of color theory, including the color wheel, primary and secondary colors, and color relationships.

Explore the unique characteristics of oil paints and how they influence color mixing.

Develop your ability to create a vast range of colors through precise mixing techniques.

Learn how to achieve subtle variations in hue, saturation, and value.

Gain the confidence to mix any color you need for your paintings.

Discover how to personalize your palette to best suit your artistic style.

This course provides a progressive learning experience, building your skills week by week. By the end, you’ll be equipped to confidently mix vibrant, harmonious colors that elevate your oil paintings to the next level. This is not a class where students will be making paintings; we will explore color mixing with oils and learn how to develop working palettes along with some basic color science for understanding.

These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

                        <p>Guide Dogs for the Blind (GDB) offers walking tours of its California campus in San Rafael, to give visitors the opportunity to learn about and observe the training and nurturing required to help these puppies on their journey to become guide dogs for people who are blind or visually impaired. Daily tours can accommodate up to 36 people, and reservations are required at least a week in advance.

The tours, which last a little more than an hour, include a stop at the Learning Lab in GDB’s state-of-the art Puppy Center, where all GDB puppies will spend the first critical eight to 10 weeks of life. The Puppy Center also includes areas for puppy birthing and puppy socialization. The Learning Lab is an educational center to expand the public’s understanding of what it takes to make a successful guide dog. While the Learning Lab stop is educational, it’s been known to melt even the most cynical heart, with its views of puppies playing, rolling, running, and mugging for selfies. The tour also includes outdoor stops in the training courtyard and the residential courtyard, where visitors learn about training and other aspects of GDB’s three programs: Guide Dog Mobility Program, Orientation and Mobility (O&M) Program, and K9 Buddy Program. Visit GDB tours for more information and to book your tour. 

Tours run Mondays through Fridays at 10 am, July 1 through December 30, 2024.

If you've yet to attend an Off the Page Readers Theater Perfomance you are in for a treat. Think of it as an audiobook coming to life only for shorter pieces of prose and poerty.

Performances will feature these selected works of these local authors:

POEMS:

The Machines — in Memory of Jacqueline Kudler Yang v Yin — Jean Gordon Kocienda This Long Night — Lisa Shulman Rage — Sylvia Wong My Lock Down Recipe — Joan Goodreau

PROSE:

Refuge — Alethea Eason Bedroom Shadows — Mara Johnstone First Words — Joan Goodreau The Sentry — Sarah Paris

                        <p>Join artists Ken Berman and newcomer Alina Nuebel on September 6th, 5-8 PM, in the SOFA Santa Rosa Arts District at Backstreet Gallery + Studios for a show that is by turns architectural and organic, playful and quiescent, unpacking the joy and turmoil of human innovation and its parallels in the evolution of life on earth, finding the art in science, and the science in art.

Ken Berman is a Northern California, self-taught, Outsider Artist whose work combines the energy of the urban environment with the mechanics of our modern age.  His work often incorporates a variety of mediums and techniques with ideas meant to engage the viewer’s full imagination.

Alina Nuebel is a biologist and artist who combines the fine-focus eye of a field scientist with an expressive, painterly energy to invite as sense awe for the humble or overlooked aspects of the environment we walk through every day.

Come prepared for a fresh perspective where Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics are energized with Art to create a show that transcends the world of the ordinary.</p>

Being a parent of a neurodiverse child opens up a unique chapter of parenting challenges, including decisions around education.  Do you feel overwhelmed by the IEP process?  It’s easy to feel isolated and confused even when you’re investing hours in trying to understand and navigate your child’s IEP.  

You are not alone, and this workshop will answer all your questions and review steps in the IEP process to help guide you toward finding the right program for your child.</p>

                        <p>“From the series, *Woman and Fox, A Journey*, these pastel paintings have allowed me to work my way through my own inner journey.   I have walked through many of these landscapes physicially and they have offered me places to contemplate, new paths to explore, and places to stop, reflect and rest. These journeys have offered sunlit moments of revelation, awareness, and comfort.  *Journeys of the Soul*  also include paintings of the lush inner landscape of an imagination we share. *Woman and Fox* have  continued to travel together through twenty-nine paintings as my own personal journey continues.”   Teri Sloat

Show runs from August 2 through September 28. Reception August 17, 4-6pm.</p>

                        <p>Calling all Bird Lovers and Those who wish to Learn More about Birds in Sonoma County.

Do you want a chance to join us to support birds by helping to rescue, rehabilitate and release??

The Bird Rescue Center has Volunteer Opportunities for you to support their efforts in rescuing, rehabbing and releasing native birds in Sonoma County.

Birds are omnipresent. We do not go a day without seeing a bird or hearing a birdsong. They are our best-known connection to a natural world that is fast disappearing.  Imagine for a moment if their sound were silenced…?

For over 40 years, The Bird Rescue Center \(BRC\) has been caring for our native wild bird populations in Sonoma County and in other regions of the North Bay. We treat approximately 3,000 birds annually with a success rate of over 80%.

The Bird Rescue Center will be hosting a New Volunteer Orientation on Saturday, September 28th from 11am to 1pm.  If interested in attending and learning how you can become a volunteer with The Bird Rescue Center, please RSVP to 707-523-2473 or contact Kelsey Escoto, Volunteer Coordinator at kelsey@thebirdrescuecenter.org.  For more information, please visit our web site: https://www.birdrescuecenter.org/</p>

We invite you to taste that legacy with the release of the coveted 2021 vintage of this limited-production wine, along with a selection of winery-exclusive bottlings paired with seasonal bites at our family estate.

                        <p>Location: Jack London State Historic Park</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Have you ever been lured by the siren song to set sail for the South Pacific?  Learn about two couples who made it a reality, Jack and Charmian London and Rob and Nancy Novak.

For Jack and Charmian London, living and owning land near Glen Ellen was a way of escaping Oakland, from the city way of life he called “the man trap.” But, restless and eager for foreign travel and adventure, he and his wife, Charmian London, decided to build a ship, the Snark, and sail around the world, serializing his adventure.

Nancy and Rob Novak, Sonoma County residents and real-life sailors left on their cruise of a lifetime in 2012. During that time, unknowingly, they visited some of the London’s South Seas destinations like the Society Islands \(Tahiti, Moorea, Huahine, Bora Bora and Raiatea\), 105 years after Jack London’s Snark came to call.

Join Nancy and Rob Novak for an enchanting afternoon as they recount their amazing voyage. They will set the stage with a summary of Jack and Charmian’s South Seas sailing adventures before sharing their personal story of sailing their own 48 ft sailboat, “Shindig” in the Mexican and South Pacific waters for over a decade.

“Our goal was to go on our own sailing adventure. We had been sailing in the SF Bay for many years, and our sailboat Shindig was bought specifically for an offshore adventure.  We resigned from our jobs, and spent a year downsizing our belongings and  putting the rest into storage. Our initial plan was to take 1-2 years off of work, and see where the winds would take us.  We thought we’d stay in Mexico for a year, and then possibly go across the Pacific Ocean to the South Pacific.  When we finished our adventure, we had sailed over 14 years and covered 15,000 nautical miles. “

                        <p>Join us for a chill Saturday afternoon with live music by John Trubee and enjoy some happy hour specials!

Welcome to Saturday Live Music Happy Hour with John Trubee at Barrel Proof Lounge ! Join us for a fantastic evening filled with great music and good vibes. John Trubee will be performing live, bringing his unique style and talent to our stage. Come enjoy some drinks, relax, and unwind after a long week. This event is the perfect way to kick off your weekend with some awesome tunes. Don't miss out on this special performance! See you there!

The mischievous musical creations of John Trubee are unlike anything else in the world of pop. Known by few and understood by fewer, the longtime songwriter, bandleader and now record-label owner has called Sonoma County home for more than 30 years, yet his hermetic lifestyle and rejection of all things commercial have kept him out of the spotlight—and he wouldn’t have it any other way.

                        <p>Christopher Hampton's translation of the award-winning comedy by Yasmina Reza. Two couples meet to discuss a fight between their young sons. Things rapidly and uproariously take a turn for the worse, and that's BEFORE they break out the rum. Speaks to our deeply divided society, where identity politics and tribalism have superseded civility and kindness. Adult language and themes of racism, sexism, and homophobia.</p>

**You MUST have a ticket to attend this event.** Attendance is limited and, while remaining tickets will be sold at the door, they will be subject to availability. **Please note that tickets are non-refundable and cannot be used for future events. Overcast skies do not cancel the event.** In the event of poor visibility, guests are treated to an educational experience, learning the differences between telescopes and how they work, and presentations will be given throughout the evening. **Unless you are notified otherwise by email, the event is not cancelled. Also, you must purchase a Sugarloaf Ridge State Park parking pass to attend this event, which can be purchased here with your tickets** (unless you have an annual Sugarloaf parking pass, or a state parking pass. Please note that the Sonoma County regional park pass does not apply for this state park.)

Please note, members can attend this event for free. If you'd like to become a member, please fill out a member application form and you will be sent a promotional code to use when purchasing tickets. Be advised that parking passes for Sugarloaf Ridge State Park are still required, and can also be purchased through this order form. Sugarloaf annual parking passes can also be purchased here: https://sugarloafpark.org/support/.  

Cost is $15.00 per adult, $10 for students and seniors 62+, $5 for youth 6-12, and children 5 and under are FREE.  (Note: while children tickets are free, they are still required.)

Dogs are not allowed inside the observatory or at public star parties.

We are pleased to be a part of the nationwide Museums for All initiative, which provides access to museums and related venues to low-income individuals and families. EBT card holders can present their EBT cards at check-in to receive up to 4 free passes to a public star party. Parking at Sugarloaf Ridge State Park will also be waived to EBT card holders for the duration of the public star party. Please use the parking pass option for EBT-card holders at check-out. 

When to arrive: Visitors are welcome to arrive at any time within the three hour period of the star party. We suggest families with children arrive close to the start time, and others arrive an hour or so later to minimize wait times at the telescopes. It is recommended to arrive no later than two hours after the start time. 

RFO is operated by the Valley of the Moon Observatory Association, a 501(3)(c) nonprofit organization, and all of the proceeds will go towards maintaining this beloved Sonoma county institution.

                        <p>This triathlon series was created to help bring the sport of triathlon to Sonoma County. These are short distance triathlons/duathlon open to all levels of ability. This is an excellent first race and will help you succeed in a non-competitive atmosphere. All are welcome to participate. Excellent for novices, great competition for the seasoned triathlete. This event is non-competitive and time is not recorded. It is designed for you to complete and enjoy. The race starts at Finley Aquatic Center and travels along the Santa Rosa Creek Trail for the bike and run course. Included in each athlete’s registration fee is custom Team DJFE medal, a swim cap, and an athlete goody bag. Proceeds from this event will benefit Inspiration Sports Foundation, a local 501c3 that serves the youth of Sonoma County through sports camps and other fitness related activities.</p>

                        <p>HEALDSBURG --

Celebrate the release of *The Night We Lost Him* with *New York Times* bestselling author Laura Dave!

Taste Little Saint’s freshly brewed coffee, enjoy a reading, meet the author, grab a picture and get your books signed.

Join us for a Sunday morning celebration at The Second Story inside Little Saint in Downtown Healdsburg.

**From the author of *The Last Thing He Told Me—*the #1 *New York Times* bestselling blockbuster and Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick—comes an epic love story wrapped in a riveting mystery.**

**"Dave is the founder and master of a new kind of thriller. One that sets love, not death, at the fulcrum. A tour de force of emotion." -** Rebecca Serle, *NYTimes* bestselling author of *Expiration Dates*

**When the patriarch of a famed hotel empire dies under suspicious circumstances, his daughter and her estranged brother join forces to find out what happened, unraveling a larger mystery about who their father really was.**

Liam Noone was many things to many people. To the public, he was an exacting, self-made hotel magnate fleeing his past. To his three ex-wives, he was a loving albeit distant family man who kept his finances flush and his families carefully separated. To Nora, he was a father who often loved her from afar—notably a cliffside cottage perched on the California coast from which he fell to his death.

The authorities rule the death accidental, but Nora’s brother Sam has other ideas. Sam, who she barely knows. As Nora and Sam form an uneasy alliance to unravel the mystery, they start putting together the pieces of their father’s past—and find an unexpected answer about their own future.

Doubling down on her trademark soulful suspense, *The Night We Lost Him* is an evocative and unforgettable page-turner about what it means to be the witness to someone’s life.

**Author:** Laura Dave is the #1 *New York Times* bestselling author of *The Last Thing He Told Me*, *Eight Hundred Grapes*, and other novels. Her work has been published in thirty-eight countries. *The Last Thing He Told Me* has sold three million copies and is now a limited series on Apple TV+. She resides in Santa Monica, California.

**This is a ticketed event. Each ticket includes admission for 1 and a copy of *The Last Thing He Told Me*handed out at check-in.**</p>

                        <p>August 25 @ 10:00 Am – 1:00 Pm

Schedule: Last Sunday of the Month; August – November Full Schedule: August 25, September 29, October 27, November 24 Time: 10:00 AM – 1:00 PM Total Sessions: 4 Instructor: Jessica Fudim Location: Room 213, Dance Studio Ages: Adults, 18\+ Skill Level: All Levels Registration Fee: $50 for all 4 sessions

The Sonoma Community Center’s Movement: Collab Lab is a 4-month series of dance experiments for curious artists. With support from the facilitator and fellow Collab Lab artists, each participant will have a chance to design and lead a simple movement exploration. Open to any artist whose medium is movement, or who seeks to inspire their art by working with bodies in space.

In our first Lab \(August\), we will focus on building connection within the group through playful tasks that emphasize listening, reflection and collaboration. Participants will also use the August Lab time to build a plan for exploring their dance-related curiosities. 

Over the course of the following Labs \(September – November\), we will each take one turn engaging the group in our dance experiments. Examples include, but are not limited to: group movement improvisations, performing existing solo material for feedback, posing questions for discussion, or cross-pollinating dance with other art forms.

Each Lab will include an accessible movement warm-up and a short snack break. Wear comfortable layers, and be prepared to move without street shoes \(bare feet, socks, clean sneakers or dance shoes are allowed\).

Please share any special considerations \(medical, physical, learning\) that will help your instructor make your class accessible and accommodating for you. You can share these considerations when you register or by emailing Sean at sean@sonomacommunitycenter.org.

                        <p>HEALDSBURG --

Celebrate the release of The Night We Lost Him with New York Times bestselling author Laura Dave! 

Taste Little Saint’s freshly brewed coffee, enjoy a reading, meet the author, grab a picture and get your books signed.

Join us for a Sunday morning celebration at The Second Story inside Little Saint in Downtown Healdsburg.

From the author of The Last Thing He Told Me—the #1 New York Times bestselling blockbuster and Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick—comes an epic love story wrapped in a riveting mystery.

"Dave is the founder and master of a new kind of thriller. One that sets love, not death, at the fulcrum. A tour de force of emotion." - Rebecca Serle, New York Times bestselling author of Expiration Dates

When the patriarch of a famed hotel empire dies under suspicious circumstances, his daughter and her estranged brother join forces to find out what happened, unraveling a larger mystery about who their father really was.

Liam Noone was many things to many people. To the public, he was an exacting, self-made hotel magnate fleeing his past. To his three ex-wives, he was a loving albeit distant family man who kept his finances flush and his families carefully separated. To Nora, he was a father who often loved her from afar—notably a cliffside cottage perched on the California coast from which he fell to his death.

The authorities rule the death accidental, but Nora’s brother Sam has other ideas. Sam, who she barely knows. As Nora and Sam form an uneasy alliance to unravel the mystery, they start putting together the pieces of their father’s past—and find an unexpected answer about their own future.

Doubling down on her trademark soulful suspense, The Night We Lost Him is an evocative and unforgettable page-turner about what it means to be the witness to someone’s life.

Author: Laura Dave is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Last Thing He Told Me, Eight Hundred Grapes, and other novels. Her work has been published in thirty-eight countries. The Last Thing He Told Me has sold three million copies and is now a limited series on Apple TV+. She resides in Santa Monica, California.

This is a ticketed event. Each ticket includes admission for 1 and a copy of The Last Thing He Told Me handed out at check-in.</p>

Those PD readers who have attended regularly know this series to be a joyful festival which began following the height of the pandemic when poets and audiences were hungering to get out and mingle. Each subsequent gathering has been similarly well-received by large (at least by poetry reading standards) audiences. Come one, Come all!  Come early to enjoy lunch and listen to the jazz!</p>

Author Mark Tate shares selections from his latest book of poetry "Walking Scarecrow", along with former Marin Poet Laureate Prartho Sereno who will share her latest poetry. Audience Q&A, book sales & signing. Refreshments available. Join us for an afternoon of poetry!  Mark Tate Walking Scarecrow: The Poems of Pineshadow Walking Scarecrow: The Poems of Pineshadow is a dialogue with Hanshan, the Chinese mountain hermit beloved for his brief poems about life far away from court life in the early 7th century. About thirteen hundred years after Hanshan, an old man who is more scarecrow than active citizen of a community walks each day pondering some of the same subjects that entertained the Chinese master.   Prartho Sereno  Starfall in the Temple In Prartho Sereno's poems, the daily doesn't collide against the cosmic but collaborates with it. Writing with the eyes of a mystic seeker whose heart is wise enough not to take itself too seriously, the poetry of Starfall in the Temple veers wondrously from scientific speculation to natural delight, from mathematical proof to child's play. More than anything, each poem is a little lesson on how to love properly-and how to love properly, Sereno suggests, is to learn to love all. ~ Dan Beachy-Quick, poet and translator of The Thinking Root   Biographies/Testimonials Mark Tate is the author of three novels, Beside the River, its sequel River's End \(McCaa Books, 2021\), and Butterfly on the Wheel \(McCaa Books, 2022\). He served for ten years on the Sonoma County Poet Selection Committee for the poets laureate of that county. His book of poems Walking Scarecrow, awarded the Blue Light Press Book of the Year, was published December 2023. He is a long-time resident of Sonoma County where he lives with his wife, Lori. Poet Laureate Emerita Terry Ehret said that "alluding to the Tang poet Hanshan, Tate writes, "I use what remedy / Is at hand to save the world." Tate's depiction of a Zen tea ceremony midway through the collection offers a kind of ars poetica, simultaneously describing the ritual and his verses, "bowing to every honored thing." Local poet Sandra Anfang, author of Finishing School: "Mark Tate's new volume of poems is a microcosm of large-scale wisdom and beauty. Generously including bits of conversations with the ancients - Basho, Li Po, and . . . Cold Mountain." Prartho Sereno's most recent collection, Starfall in the Temple, was published by Blue Light Press, Fall 2023. Her four other full-length collections include Indian Rope Trick, Elephant Raga, Call from Paris, and her illustrated Causing a Stir: The Secret Lives and Loves of Kitchen Utensils, all of which won national prizes. Poet Laureate Emerita of Marin County \(2015-17\), MFA Syracuse University \(2013\), and Radio Disney Super Teacher \(2005\), Prartho attributes over four years in an Indian ashram as her strongest creative influence, but she also credits excursions into other art forms: counseling psychologist, vegetarian cook, mother of 2, meditation and yoga instructor at Cornell University, book and cover illustrator, and amateur singer-songwriter. She was a Poet in the Schools for 21 years and currently teaches The Poetic Pilgrimage: Poem-Making as Spiritual Practice online.  "The magnificent poems of Prartho Sereno reground us in our bodies, in the glistening syllables and scenes surrounding us. They retune us to a tender, more palpably luminous world we would prefer to inhabit." ~ Naomi Shihab Nye Tagged: fall2024</p>
