DESCRIPTION:Creed Bratton's story has always been a music story\, but a re
 lentless drive for success and a stroke of luck led him down an entirely d
 ifferent path in Scranton\, PA. Now\, as he prepares to release his 10th s
 tudio album\, *Tao Pop*\, on September 27\, Bratton cements his place in 
 music history as he blissfully explores his many interpretations of pop mu
 sic.\n\n*Tao Pop* marks Creed’s fifth time working with multiple Grammy 
 Award-winning producers Dave Way (Michael Jackson\, Fiona Apple) and Dillo
 n O’Brian (Keith Urban\, Brian Wilson\, Ringo Starr). To collaborate on 
 four individual tracks\, he brought in longtime friends Billy Harvey\, Geo
 ff Pearlman\, Vance DeGeneres\, and Dillon O’Brian.\n\nThe album’s art
 work was inspired by Ray Kurzweil’s *The Singularity Is Near*\; after r
 eading it\, Creed envisioned the image while meditating\, imagining a worl
 d where AI-bots and humans coexist seamlessly. In this dream\, Creed is th
 e last human standing\, thriving in a world dominated by robots and AI—a
  poignant metaphor for his enduring presence in the music world.

DESCRIPTION:Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experie
 nce needed\, all are welcome!!\n\nThis group is more than one individual a
 nd is held by volunteers\, if you are interested please contact through th
 e information below.\n\nArt therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no
  matter what we are going through in life\, we still have the ability to c
 reate and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life 
 experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into the
 rapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going o
 n internally. In that way\, we can come back to pieces that represent spec
 ific times in our life!\n\n- sonni king\n\nWe all need means of expression
  and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible wa
 y to heal.\n\nThere are so many things and burdens we carry in life\, and 
 not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a s
 pace where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating someth
 ing is beautiful\, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we l
 earn about that feeling from a different perspective.\n\nArt therapy will 
 include art supplies\, group grounding and group sharing\, feel free to br
 ing unfinished projects\, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone wh
 o wants to volunteer their time\, donate\, guide the group\, or have any q
 uestions should contact me here:\n\n707-396-9318\n\nOr contact Arlene Fran
 cis center\n\nThank you so much and I'm very excited to continue the gathe
 rings that Sonni originally created.\n\n- Angelica Gude

 N:   Saturday\, September 7\, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell
  and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate
  the show.  Refreshments will be served.\n\n**Sonoma County artist\, Mars
 ha Connell\,** presents **Tidal Effects\,** new oil paintings from obser
 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t
 he California Arts Council\, Connell held leadership roles and participate
 d for years in Art Trails Open Studios\, Art at the Source\, and this year
 ’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collecte
 d at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.
 \n\nMeet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and Se
 ptember 8\, 11 am – 6 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Small Works Showcase presents
  **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**\, a collection of watercolor and go
 uache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the a
 rtist’s attention.  From Carmel\, to France to the Swiss Alps\, no airl
 ine ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing 
 coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fisherme
 n stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. \n\nMeet the

 N:   Saturday\, September 7\, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell
  and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate
  the show.  Refreshments will be served.\n\n**Sonoma County artist\, Mars
 ha Connell\,** presents **Tidal Effects\,** new oil paintings from obser
 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t
 he California Arts Council\, Connell held leadership roles and participate
 d for years in Art Trails Open Studios\, Art at the Source\, and this year
 ’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collecte
 d at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.
 \n\nMeet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and Se
 ptember 8\, 11 am – 6 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Small Works Showcase presents
  **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**\, a collection of watercolor and go
 uache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the a
 rtist’s attention.  From Carmel\, to France to the Swiss Alps\, no airl
 ine ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing 
 coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fisherme
 n stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. \n\nMeet the

 N:   Saturday\, September 7\, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell
  and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate
  the show.  Refreshments will be served.\n\n**Sonoma County artist\, Mars
 ha Connell\,** presents **Tidal Effects\,** new oil paintings from obser
 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t
 he California Arts Council\, Connell held leadership roles and participate
 d for years in Art Trails Open Studios\, Art at the Source\, and this year
 ’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collecte
 d at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.
 \n\nMeet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and Se
 ptember 8\, 11 am – 6 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Small Works Showcase presents
  **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**\, a collection of watercolor and go
 uache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the a
 rtist’s attention.  From Carmel\, to France to the Swiss Alps\, no airl
 ine ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing 
 coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fisherme
 n stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. \n\nMeet the
  Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 a
 m to 6 pm. \n\n**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Ga

 on flowers\, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa
  JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely

 FECTS** \n\nEXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22\, 2024\n\nRECEPTIO
 N:   Saturday\, September 7\, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell
  and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate
  the show.  Refreshments will be served.\n\n**Sonoma County artist\, Mars
 ha Connell\,** presents **Tidal Effects\,** new oil paintings from obser
 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t
 he California Arts Council\, Connell held leadership roles and participate
 d for years in Art Trails Open Studios\, Art at the Source\, and this year
 ’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collecte
 d at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.
 \n\nMeet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and Se
 ptember 8\, 11 am – 6 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Small Works Showcase presents
  **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**\, a collection of watercolor and go
 uache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the a
 rtist’s attention.  From Carmel\, to France to the Swiss Alps\, no airl
 ine ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing 
 coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fisherme
 n stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. \n\nMeet the
  Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 a
 m to 6 pm. \n\n**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Ga
 llery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident\, she is inspired by its quinte
 ssential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses 
 on flowers\, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa
  JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely 
 colorful\, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at
  the Gallery.\n\n**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14\, 5:30 – 7:30 p

 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin

 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an

 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros

 FECTS** \n\nEXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22\, 2024\n\nRECEPTIO
 N:   Saturday\, September 7\, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell
  and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate
  the show.  Refreshments will be served.\n\n**Sonoma County artist\, Mars
 ha Connell\,** presents **Tidal Effects\,** new oil paintings from obser
 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t
 he California Arts Council\, Connell held leadership roles and participate
 d for years in Art Trails Open Studios\, Art at the Source\, and this year
 ’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collecte
 d at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.
 \n\nMeet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and Se
 ptember 8\, 11 am – 6 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Small Works Showcase presents
  **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**\, a collection of watercolor and go
 uache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the a
 rtist’s attention.  From Carmel\, to France to the Swiss Alps\, no airl
 ine ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing 
 coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fisherme
 n stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. \n\nMeet the
  Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 a
 m to 6 pm. \n\n**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Ga
 llery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident\, she is inspired by its quinte
 ssential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses 
 on flowers\, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa
  JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely 
 colorful\, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at
  the Gallery.\n\n**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14\, 5:30 – 7:30 p

SUMMARY:Andre Nickatina
DTSTART:20240908T040000Z
DTEND:20240908T065800Z
UID:240814eFrIbX-lFUeldn_Cbd8zdg
DESCRIPTION:Born and raised in the Fillmore District of San Francisco\, An
 dre Nickatina has been a Hip-Hop/Rap luminary since the release of his cri
 tically acclaimed debut\, The New Jim Jones. A favorite at public venues a
 nd on college campuses\, Andre Nickatina continues to sustain a loyal fan-
 base\, while engaging new supporters throughout North America. Nickatina
 ’s classic stage show combined with his rare interviews\, maintains his 
 mystery and unique musicianship that has spanned two decades.\n\nThe longe
 vity of Nickatina speaks for itself. An award-winning MC and producer (200
 5 Bay Area Artist of The Year / Album of The Year for Bullets)\, Nickatina
 ’s vision has expanded beyond the 18 albums (and hundreds of thousands o
 f sales) that he has executive-produced. Also\, a diverse artist\, Nickati
 na has gained critical acclaim for his work and vision as a filmmaker\, wi
 th more than seven films to his credit as either a director\, co-director\
 , executive producer\, producer or actor.\n\nChanging his name from Dre Do
 g to Andre Nickatina in 1996\, he transformed his career to a plateau that
  has allowed him to create and develop an entirely new fan base with his o
 riginal flow\, distinct voice and lyrical explorations that few other MCs 
 have displayed an ability to achieve. His third album\, Raven In My Eyes\,
  marked Nickatina’s shift as an artist and expanded his audience to the 
 wildly enthusiastic college crowds that praise him with regular sellouts f
 rom coast to coast. In 2008 Nickatina completed a timeless masterwork that
  paired he and his friend\, Mac Dre (R.I.P.) together with the new classic
 \, A Tale of Two Andres.\n\nNickatina’s business acumen is as sharp and 
 honorable as his presence on stage. Nickatina’s vision as an artist has 
 been admired by many of his peers as he is seen as one of the last Bay Are
 a Legends who was not only present during the golden-era of Hip-Hop\, but 
 one of the few artists who has helped Hip-Hop grow and who has remained ul
 timately relevant with each successive album he has released. Without say
 ing so\, Nickatina has had his finger on the pulse of what is raw\, uncut 
 and capable of capturing the mind and ears of listeners. Never one to foll
 ow or ride trends\, Andre Nickatina is a rare breed of artist… one of th
 e last original trend setters. Nickatina does not do what the people want
 … rather the people want to know what Dre will do next.

 e a potent mix of swing and vintage dance music with a dynamic\, soulful d
 elivery. Led by vocalist Emily Day \\(“one of the major singers in her f
 ield” – Scott Yanow\\)\, Cosmo Alleycats draws from several decades of
  exhilarating American music\, along with inspired originals\, to deliver 
 a fun and engaging performance.\n\n​\n\nWith thirteen years' experience 
 performing together\, Cosmo Alleycats is a well-oiled machine. But however
  polished their performance may be\, it’s their sense of playfulness tha
 t holds the door open for the unexpected. This dynamic is evident in their
  2022 album\, Old Sweet Songs\, a collection of Tin Pan Alley and American
  Songbook favorites accompanied by their original compositions\, inspired 
 by bygone styles of songwriting.\n\n​\n\nCosmo Alleycats has performed a

 pany\, Ashkenaz\, The Sound Room\, House of Blues New Orleans\, Maison Fre
 nchman\, Dreamforce\, SeaWorld San Diego\, Fillmore Jazz Festival\, Reno's
  Hot August Nights\, and the Russian River Jazz & Blues Festival. You can 
 catch the band playing regularly at Local Edition\, Mr. Tipple's\, and Clu

DESCRIPTION:"The Seed of McCoy" begins as a two-fisted tale of adventure o
 n the high seas.  The action takes place in French Polynesia\, visited by
  Jack and Charmian London during the Cruise of the Snark in 1907-1908.  L
 ike other London stories\, it is partly based on a true story. It was publ
 ished in Century magazine in 1907 and 1911 as part of the “South Seas Ta
 les.”\n\nStoryteller Jeff Falconer reads "The Seed of McCoy" aloud under
  the majestic oaks for a special Jack London morning.  A discussion and r
 efreshments follow the reading.\n\nMore than 100 years later\, the same ar
 ea was visited by Nancy and Rob Novak\, Sonoma County residents and real-l
 ife sailors who left on their cruise of a lifetime in 2012 that lasted 14 
 years. During that time\, unknowingly\, they visited the same area in Fren
 ch Polynesia and much more.  To continue the story and learn more about t
 heir adventures\, attend "The Story of the Snark and Cruise of the Shindig
 " on Sept. 28. Visit https://jacklondonpark.com/events/south-pacific-cruis

 d a shared musical dream\, they add some spice to their lives\, stage a re
 vue of the Latin hits they grew up with\, and shatter Latino stereotypes.\

 tipos latinos.\n\nEntra María\, su impresionante cantante sustituta que d
 emuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mism

  My Life in Music. For her most recent title to be released in  2017\, 
 Cravings\, she provides a no-holds barred account of her harrowing strugg
 le with compulsive  overeating\, and the journey that led her to a solut
 ion. Alternating between chapters on her life and those of  the many diet
  gurus she has encountered along the way (Atkins\, Jean Nidtech of Weight 
 Watchers\, Andrew  Weil\, to name a few)\, Cravings is the culmination 
 of Judy's genuine desire to share what she's learned—so  that no one ha

 ains a social activist\, representing UNICEF and numerous other causes. Sh
 e is the  director (along with Jill Godmillow) of an Academy Award-nomin

  to conduct major symphonies around the world–and Judy's classical piano
   teacher when she was young.** \n\n**Judy Collins\, now 77\, is as crea
 tively vigorous as ever\, writing\, touring worldwide\, and nurturing fres

DESCRIPTION:Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experie
 nce needed\, all are welcome!!\n\nThis group is more than one individual a
 nd is held by volunteers\, if you are interested please contact through th
 e information below.\n\nArt therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no
  matter what we are going through in life\, we still have the ability to c
 reate and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life 
 experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into the
 rapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going o
 n internally. In that way\, we can come back to pieces that represent spec
 ific times in our life!\n\n- sonni king\n\nWe all need means of expression
  and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible wa
 y to heal.\n\nThere are so many things and burdens we carry in life\, and 
 not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a s
 pace where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating someth
 ing is beautiful\, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we l
 earn about that feeling from a different perspective.\n\nArt therapy will 
 include art supplies\, group grounding and group sharing\, feel free to br
 ing unfinished projects\, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone wh
 o wants to volunteer their time\, donate\, guide the group\, or have any q
 uestions should contact me here:\n\n707-396-9318\n\nOr contact Arlene Fran
 cis center\n\nThank you so much and I'm very excited to continue the gathe
 rings that Sonni originally created.\n\n- Angelica Gude

 om 8:15-10:30pm with one intermission**\n\nA musical showcase of two coupl

 erFactor** (Jon Strider and Robin Factor). \n\nOriginally from the SF Bay
  Area\, Jon spent 16 years in the music trenches of LA before emigrating t
 o Sweden in 2001\, where he forged a music career that includes nine solo 
 albums\, two hit songs on Swedish National Radio\, and widespread airplay 
 throughout Europe. Jon's original songs connect deeply with listeners on t
 hemes such as love’s loss & fulfillment and the immigrant’s journey. H
 e joined forces with life-long Sonoma County resident Robin in 2020. Their
  song 'In the days of Quarantine\,' co-written and recorded during the C\;
 ovid lockdown\, was favorably received on local and Swedish airwaves. They
  divide their time between Malmö Sweden and Forestville CA.\n\nhttps://ww

 ou and Michael Ryge** Sweetness\, compassion\, and a deep connection with 
 the natural world infuse the songs of Lindalou and Michael\, high school s
 weethearts who’ve been making music together since 1973. With beautifull
 y blended harmonies and inventive lyrics they describe their life in the r
 ugged hills above Calistoga\, and their encounters with the modern world. 
 Their job for the past several years is playing in elder care facilities w
 here they mostly play old familiar standards and get folks singing along. 
 Their first album 'Beginner's Luck' was released in 2003\\[\, and a 2nd al

DESCRIPTION:LLEAGLES – The premier tribute to the music of the Eagles\n\
 nWhat do people want when they go see a live band? The members of SF Bay A
 rea based tribute band ILLEAGLES believe that everyone in the crowd wants 
 to be engaged and captivated from the first note until the show is done. O
 ver the past year and a half of sold out performances\, that is exactly wh
 at every crowd has gotten.\n\nILLEAGLES was founded in late 2016 when 6 fr
 iends came together who all had 2 things in common: 1) they loved the musi
 c of the Eagles\, and 2) each member was an amazing musician in their own 
 right. This common vision led to hours and hours of studying\, rehearsing\
 , and mastering each of the Eagles classic hits.\n\nFrom rockers Life in t
 he Fast Lane and Heartache Tonight\, to swooning ballads Desperado and Bes
 t of My Love\, ILLEAGLES not only reproduce the soaring guitars\, multi-pa
 rt harmonies and tightness of the original band\, but also add their own b
 rand of swagger and energy that keeps fans coming back over and over. It
 ’s commonplace for a majority of the audience to start singing along on 
 the first song\, and continuing to sing until the show is over (or they lo
 se their voices).\n\n*ILLEAGLES- A high energy\, unforgettable party that 
 leaves fans wanting more…*

  San Francisco Comedy Competition is one of the most prestigious comedy ev
 ents in North America\, launching the careers of people like Patton Oswalt
  and Ellen DeGeneres. It’s an outrageously funny evening\, where you wil
 l see the comedy stars of tomorrow competing for their chance at fame and 
 fortune. Hundreds of comedians audition each year to compete. Only 30 are 
 chosen. \n\nMany talented comedians have since emerged from this annual ev
 ent to become major stars. The Comedy Competition develops its contestants
  by forcing them to adjust to a variety of audiences—comedy clubs\, coll
 eges\, casinos\, and theaters—while enduring the strain of an extended r
 oad trip. \n\n1977 Comedy Competition Champ Dana Carvey went on to “Satu
 rday Night Live.” 1979 Champ Marsha Warfield went on to “Night Court
 ” to star as Roz the bailiff. 1982 finalist Kevin Pollak has achieved a 
 major film career\, as has 1987 finalist Rob Schneider. Two first runners 
 up\, Ellen DeGeneres in 1985 and Mark Curry in 1989\, landed their own TV 
 series. \n\nWith this history\, the San Francisco Comedy Competition has e
 arned its reputation as an important showcase of young entertainers who wi

 clear and quiet your mind. The uses of a labyrinth are many\; relief from 
 stress and anxiety\, healing\, meditation\, problem solving\, enhancing in
 tuition\, expanding thought processes\, communicating with the Divine\, ba
 lancing mind\, body and spirit\, letting go of unwanted energies\, obtaini
 ng goals\, celebrating and remembering others\, building trust in yourself
  or others\, and coping with grief\, sorrow and loss. The labyrinth is an 
 ancient symbol that relates to wholeness. It combines the imagery of the c
 ircle and the spiral into a meandering but purposeful path. The Labyrinth 
 represents a journey to our own center and back again out into the world. 
 Labyrinths have long been used as meditation and prayer tools.\n\nLooking

DESCRIPTION:West County Fiddle Workshop \\(every 3rd Tuesday from 7-9 PM\\
 ) In this 2-hour workshop\, we'll dive into a new fiddle tune every month.
  American traditional fiddle music is vast\, with deep Celtic roots and a 
 fascinating multi-cultural history that gave birth to old-time music\, and
  later to bluegrass. Each month\, we'll work on a new tune from one of the
 se three genres. After learning the basic melody\, we'll explore the nuanc
 es that make each tune & style come alive. All stringed instruments and le
 vels are welcome\, but students should be comfortable enough on their inst
 ruments that they can learn bite-sized phrases of a melody by ear.  David 
 Pascoe is a singer and multi-instrumentalist based in Occidental\, CA. In 
 addition to being a passionate music educator and the co-founder of Every 
 Folk \\(a 3-day camp for adults to explore traditional music and culture\\
 )\, he performs with multiple groups up and down the West Coast on fiddle\
 , mandolin\, and guitar. He lives for the moment when music comes alive in
  the people around him. Workshop fee is $25\, $20 for OCA members.  Regist

DESCRIPTION:Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experie
 nce needed\, all are welcome!!\n\nThis group is more than one individual a
 nd is held by volunteers\, if you are interested please contact through th
 e information below.\n\nArt therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no
  matter what we are going through in life\, we still have the ability to c
 reate and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life 
 experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into the
 rapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going o
 n internally. In that way\, we can come back to pieces that represent spec
 ific times in our life!\n\n- sonni king\n\nWe all need means of expression
  and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible wa
 y to heal.\n\nThere are so many things and burdens we carry in life\, and 
 not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a s
 pace where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating someth
 ing is beautiful\, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we l
 earn about that feeling from a different perspective.\n\nArt therapy will 
 include art supplies\, group grounding and group sharing\, feel free to br
 ing unfinished projects\, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone wh
 o wants to volunteer their time\, donate\, guide the group\, or have any q
 uestions should contact me here:\n\n707-396-9318\n\nOr contact Arlene Fran

 rings that Sonni originally created.\n\n- Angelica Gude

 ed the top standup comedians who preform in clubs across California and th
 e country and brought them to Petaluma to make you laugh harder then you e
 ver have before in.\n\nYour headliner Derek Sheen is a cuddly mess of ins
 ecurities and a gifted\, one-of-a-kind storyteller. His ability to mine hu
 mor from the dark\, humid corners of the human condition has made him a cu
 lt favorite of comedy nerds around the globe.\n\nDespite a lack of televis
 ion or film credits\, he has amassed a pretty loyal fan base touring with 
 comedy legends \\(name-drop alert!\\) Brian Posehn\, Patton Oswalt and Jan
 eane Garofalo.\n\nDerek Sheen has released four critically acclaimed album
 s on Minneapolis based Stand Up! Records\, with Grammy Winning producer Da
 n Schlissel.\n\nAll four albums are available for streaming on Spotify and
  Apple Music right now!\n\nTyler Hinz is a Bay area favorite and has rack
 ed up a fair amount of comedy credits. The 30-year-old South Bay standup k
 nown for his quirky digressions and keen\, off-the-cuff observations—he'
 s been compared to Rory Scovel—has opened for a number of high-profile c
 omedians at Rooster T. Feathers and the San Jose Improv\, including Darren
  Carter\, Ron Shock and Marc Curry \\(Hanging with Mr. Cooper\\).\n\nAusti
 n Blaylock hails from the secret wine capitol of California\, a small town
  called Livermore. He performs stand-up all over the Bay Area\, but his fa
 vorite haunts are San Francisco and San Jose\, as well as being featured i
 n SF Sketchfest. He’s known for hosting and producing Super Stacked\, a 
 locally renowned comedy show in San Jose\, that was featured in the San Jo
 se Metro and Content Magazine. With a charming mix of self-deprecating and
  anecdotal humor\, Austin has a natural gift for warming up a crowd\, havi
 ng opened for touring acts like Laurie Kilmartin. On a given day\, you can
  find Austin working on comedy writing\, jamming on his guitar \\(he total
 ly knows Wonderwall\\)\, or hanging with his cat\, Gus.\n\nLoren Kraut is 
 awkwardly hilarious\, Loren’s unorthodox style of comedy juxtaposes play
 fulness with deeply dark humor. She turns grim subject matter\, like depre
 ssion and suicide\, on its ear\, presenting the bleakness of mental illnes
 s with unexpected wit and levity. Ever the outsider\, Loren gives us a gli
 mpse into her weird\, silly and often tragic world that\, in the end\, is 
 surprisingly life affirming.\n\nDvontre Coleman is a comedian based in Sa
 n Francisco\, CA. Growing up he moved a lot\, but the one thing he took wi
 th him everywhere was the ability to laugh. Now he just does that in front
  of strangers with a microphone.\n\nMikel Nordstrom is a standup comic an
 d producer based in the California Bay Area. He has performed at venues su
 ch as the Sacramento Punchline and Cobbs Comedy Club. Mikel has taken part
  in comedy festivals\, most recently at the 2022 Savage Henrys Comedy Fest

 lt favorite of comedy nerds around the globe.\n\nDespite a lack of televis
 ion or film credits\, he has amassed a pretty loyal fan base touring with 
 comedy legends \\(name-drop alert!\\) Brian Posehn\, Patton Oswalt and Jan
 eane Garofalo.\n\nDerek Sheen has released four critically acclaimed album
 s on Minneapolis based Stand Up! Records\, with Grammy Winning producer Da
 n Schlissel.\n\nAll four albums are available for streaming on Spotify and
  Apple Music right now!\n\nTyler Hinz is a Bay area favorite and has rack
 ed up a fair amount of comedy credits. The 30-year-old South Bay standup k
 nown for his quirky digressions and keen\, off-the-cuff observations—he'
 s been compared to Rory Scovel—has opened for a number of high-profile c
 omedians at Rooster T. Feathers and the San Jose Improv\, including Darren
  Carter\, Ron Shock and Marc Curry \\(Hanging with Mr. Cooper\\).\n\nAusti
 n Blaylock hails from the secret wine capitol of California\, a small town
  called Livermore. He performs stand-up all over the Bay Area\, but his fa
 vorite haunts are San Francisco and San Jose\, as well as being featured i
 n SF Sketchfest. He’s known for hosting and producing Super Stacked\, a 
 locally renowned comedy show in San Jose\, that was featured in the San Jo
 se Metro and Content Magazine. With a charming mix of self-deprecating and
  anecdotal humor\, Austin has a natural gift for warming up a crowd\, havi
 ng opened for touring acts like Laurie Kilmartin. On a given day\, you can
  find Austin working on comedy writing\, jamming on his guitar \\(he total
 ly knows Wonderwall\\)\, or hanging with his cat\, Gus.\n\nLoren Kraut is 
 awkwardly hilarious\, Loren’s unorthodox style of comedy juxtaposes play
 fulness with deeply dark humor. She turns grim subject matter\, like depre
 ssion and suicide\, on its ear\, presenting the bleakness of mental illnes
 s with unexpected wit and levity. Ever the outsider\, Loren gives us a gli
 mpse into her weird\, silly and often tragic world that\, in the end\, is 
 surprisingly life affirming.\n\nDvontre Coleman is a comedian based in Sa
 n Francisco\, CA. Growing up he moved a lot\, but the one thing he took wi
 th him everywhere was the ability to laugh. Now he just does that in front
  of strangers with a microphone.\n\nMikel Nordstrom is a standup comic an
 d producer based in the California Bay Area. He has performed at venues su
 ch as the Sacramento Punchline and Cobbs Comedy Club. Mikel has taken part
  in comedy festivals\, most recently at the 2022 Savage Henrys Comedy Fest
 ival. His unique voice and perspective creates for a memorable show.

DESCRIPTION:Back to All Shows\n\nCrowded House\n\nTuesday\, September 24\,
  2024\, at 8:00pm\n\n$75\, $95\, and $129\n\nFor more than four decades\, 
 Crowded House leader Neil Finn has been on an evolving\, winding journey. 
 Crowded House’s mid-‘80s hits like “Don’t Dream It’s Over” and
  “Something So Strong\,” combined with albums like Woodface and Togeth
 er Alone\, set the standard for the period’s erudite jangle-pop while al
 ways pushing the band’s art forward. That creative spirit brings Finn an
 d his Crowded House bandmates to Gravity Stairs\, their first new release 
 since 2021’s Dreamers Are Waiting and eighth overall. \n\nProduced by th
 e band with Steven Schram\, the album shows Crowded House in its current i
 ncarnation — Finn\, Nick Seymour\, Mitchell Froom\, and Finn’s sons\,
  Elroy and Liam — as sharp as ever\, feeling musically adventurous and 
 still capable of reaching the staggering highs that have made them an inte
 rnational favorite. \n\nFinn’s resume bears that out. From joining his b
 rother Tim in the 80s artful pop band\, Split Enz\, to leading Crowded Hou
 se to his numerous solo efforts\, Finn’s varied body of work is connecte
 d by his knack for penning meticulous\, indelible melodies and impressioni
 stic lyrics that demand multiple listens. It’s earned him devoted fans a
 ll over the globe\, an Order of the British Empire honor\, and induction i
 nto the Australian Recording Industry Association’s Hall of Fame. \n\nAl
 l VIP packages purchased for Crowded House will go through a third-party w
 ebsite and will be managed by Please & Thank You. There will be no refunds
  or exchanges. VIP packages will not be sold or managed through the Luther

DESCRIPTION:Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experie
 nce needed\, all are welcome!!\n\nThis group is more than one individual a
 nd is held by volunteers\, if you are interested please contact through th
 e information below.\n\nArt therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no
  matter what we are going through in life\, we still have the ability to c
 reate and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life 
 experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into the
 rapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going o
 n internally. In that way\, we can come back to pieces that represent spec
 ific times in our life!\n\n- sonni king\n\nWe all need means of expression
  and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible wa
 y to heal.\n\nThere are so many things and burdens we carry in life\, and 
 not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a s
 pace where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating someth
 ing is beautiful\, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we l
 earn about that feeling from a different perspective.\n\nArt therapy will 
 include art supplies\, group grounding and group sharing\, feel free to br
 ing unfinished projects\, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone wh
 o wants to volunteer their time\, donate\, guide the group\, or have any q
 uestions should contact me here:\n\n707-396-9318\n\nOr contact Arlene Fran
 cis center\n\nThank you so much and I'm very excited to continue the gathe
 rings that Sonni originally created.\n\n- Angelica Gude

  Charmian London and Rob and Nancy Novak.\n\nFor Jack and Charmian London\
 , living and owning land near Glen Ellen was a way of escaping Oakland\, f
 rom the city way of life he called “the man trap.” But\, restless and 
 eager for foreign travel and adventure\, he and his wife\, Charmian London
 \, decided to build a ship\, the Snark\, and sail around the world\, seria
 lizing his adventure.\n\nNancy and Rob Novak\, Sonoma County residents and
  real-life sailors left on their cruise of a lifetime in 2012. During that
  time\, unknowingly\, they visited some of the London’s South Seas desti
 nations like the Society Islands \\(Tahiti\, Moorea\, Huahine\, Bora Bora 
 and Raiatea\\)\, 105 years after Jack London’s Snark came to call.\n\nJo
 in Nancy and Rob Novak for an enchanting afternoon as they recount their a
 mazing voyage. They will set the stage with a summary of Jack and Charmian
 ’s South Seas sailing adventures before sharing their personal story of 
 sailing their own 48 ft sailboat\, “Shindig” in the Mexican and South 
 Pacific waters for over a decade.\n\n“Our goal was to go on our own sail
 ing adventure. We had been sailing in the SF Bay for many years\, and our 
 sailboat Shindig was bought specifically for an offshore adventure.  We r
 esigned from our jobs\, and spent a year downsizing our belongings and  p
 utting the rest into storage. Our initial plan was to take 1-2 years off o
 f work\, and see where the winds would take us.  We thought we’d stay i
 n Mexico for a year\, and then possibly go across the Pacific Ocean to the
  South Pacific.  When we finished our adventure\, we had sailed over 14 y
 ears and covered 15\,000 nautical miles. “\n\nNote: Limited seating is a

DESCRIPTION:DOUBLE BOOK LAUNCH - Mark Tate and Prartho Sereno Free event! 
 Author Mark Tate shares selections from his latest book of poetry "Walking
  Scarecrow"\, along with former Marin Poet Laureate Prartho Sereno who wil
 l share her latest poetry. Audience Q&A\, book sales & signing. Refreshmen
 ts available. Join us for an afternoon of poetry!  Mark Tate Walking Scare
 crow: The Poems of Pineshadow Walking Scarecrow: The Poems of Pineshadow i
 s a dialogue with Hanshan\, the Chinese mountain hermit beloved for his br
 ief poems about life far away from court life in the early 7th century. Ab
 out thirteen hundred years after Hanshan\, an old man who is more scarecro
 w than active citizen of a community walks each day pondering some of the 
 same subjects that entertained the Chinese master.   Prartho Sereno  Starf
 all in the Temple In Prartho Sereno's poems\, the daily doesn't collide ag
 ainst the cosmic but collaborates with it. Writing with the eyes of a myst
 ic seeker whose heart is wise enough not to take itself too seriously\, th
 e poetry of Starfall in the Temple veers wondrously from scientific specul
 ation to natural delight\, from mathematical proof to child's play. More t
 han anything\, each poem is a little lesson on how to love properly-and ho
 w to love properly\, Sereno suggests\, is to learn to love all. ~ Dan Beac
 hy-Quick\, poet and translator of The Thinking Root   Biographies/Testimon
 ials Mark Tate is the author of three novels\, Beside the River\, its sequ
 el River's End \\(McCaa Books\, 2021\\)\, and Butterfly on the Wheel \\(Mc
 Caa Books\, 2022\\). He served for ten years on the Sonoma County Poet Sel
 ection Committee for the poets laureate of that county. His book of poems 
 Walking Scarecrow\, awarded the Blue Light Press Book of the Year\, was pu
 blished December 2023. He is a long-time resident of Sonoma County where h
 e lives with his wife\, Lori. Poet Laureate Emerita Terry Ehret said that 
 "alluding to the Tang poet Hanshan\, Tate writes\, "I use what remedy / Is
  at hand to save the world." Tate's depiction of a Zen tea ceremony midway
  through the collection offers a kind of ars poetica\, simultaneously desc
 ribing the ritual and his verses\, "bowing to every honored thing." Local 
 poet Sandra Anfang\, author of Finishing School: "Mark Tate's new volume o
 f poems is a microcosm of large-scale wisdom and beauty. Generously includ
 ing bits of conversations with the ancients - Basho\, Li Po\, and . . . Co
 ld Mountain." Prartho Sereno's most recent collection\, Starfall in the Te
 mple\, was published by Blue Light Press\, Fall 2023. Her four other full-
 length collections include Indian Rope Trick\, Elephant Raga\, Call from P
 aris\, and her illustrated Causing a Stir: The Secret Lives and Loves of K
 itchen Utensils\, all of which won national prizes. Poet Laureate Emerita 
 of Marin County \\(2015-17\\)\, MFA Syracuse University \\(2013\\)\, and R
 adio Disney Super Teacher \\(2005\\)\, Prartho attributes over four years 
 in an Indian ashram as her strongest creative influence\, but she also cre
 dits excursions into other art forms: counseling psychologist\, vegetarian
  cook\, mother of 2\, meditation and yoga instructor at Cornell University
 \, book and cover illustrator\, and amateur singer-songwriter. She was a P
 oet in the Schools for 21 years and currently teaches The Poetic Pilgrimag
 e: Poem-Making as Spiritual Practice online.  "The magnificent poems of Pr
 artho Sereno reground us in our bodies\, in the glistening syllables and s
 cenes surrounding us. They retune us to a tender\, more palpably luminous 
 world we would prefer to inhabit." ~ Naomi Shihab Nye Tagged: fall2024
