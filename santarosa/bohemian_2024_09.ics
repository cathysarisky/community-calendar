 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros

 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t
 he California Arts Council\, Connell held leadership roles and participate
 d for years in Art Trails Open Studios\, Art at the Source\, and this year

DESCRIPTION:Jake Blount \\(pronounced: blunt\\) is an award-winning interp
 reter of Black folk music based in Providence\, RI. Initially recognized f
 or his skill as a string band musician\, Blount has charted an unprecedent
 ed\, Afrofuturist course on his pilgrimage through sound archives and song
  collections. In his hands\, the banjo\, fiddle\, electric guitar and synt
 hesizer become ceremonial objects used to channel the insurgent creativity
  of his forebears. From transfixing solo sets to full-band festival appear
 ances complete with crowd-surfing and ecstatic chants\, Blount’s perform
 ances - like his recent Smithsonian Folkways release\, The New Faith - sea
 mlessly merge centuries-old traditional songs with the trappings and techn
 iques of modern Black genres. This “genrequeer” approach to the tradit
 ions has earned his music a place in the very same archives from which he 
 extracts his repertoire. In defiance of genre categories\, revisionist his
 tories and linear time\, Blount fashions an “Afrofuturist folklore” th
 at disintegrates the boundaries between acoustic and electric\, artist and
  medium\, and ancestor and progeny.\n\nBalancing his taste for arcane sour
 ce material with his desire to reach diverse audiences\, Blount has shared
  his music at venues including the Kennedy Center\, Newport Folk Festival\
 , the Library of Congress and NPR’s Tiny Desk. His knowledge and skill h
 ave deepened over the course of his still-young career\, and his vision ha
 s grown more ambitious - but his music has only grown in popular appeal. B
 lount’s debut solo record\, Spider Tales\, was ranked among the best of 
 2020 by outlets including Bandcamp and The New Yorker. NPR\, The Guardian\
 , Rolling Stone and more named The New Faith one of the best roots release
 s of 2022. With the Steve Martin Banjo Prize\, two International Folk Musi
 c Awards nominations and two first-place ribbons from Clifftop already und
 er his belt\, Blount’s star continues to rise.\n\nBlount’s thoughtful 
 musicianship has made him a sought-after collaborator. He has contributed 
 to recordings by Adia Victoria\, Dave Hause\, Adeem The Artist and others\
 , opened for GRAMMY-winners Rhiannon Giddens and Molly Tuttle\, and travel
 ed the world as a member of old-time groups Tui and The Moose Whisperers. 
 He regularly shares the stage with skilled contemporaries such as Mali Obo
 msawin\, George Jackson\, Nic Gareiss\, Laurel Premo\, and Tatiana Hargrea
 ves.\n\nIn addition to his public-facing achievements\, Blount has an impr
 essive industry track record. He has performed as an official showcase art
 ist at Folk Alliance International\, SXSW\, AmericanaFest and the Internat
 ional Bluegrass Music Association’s World of Bluegrass. He was a 2020 St
 rathmore Artist In Residence\, and participated in the IBMA’s Leadership
  Bluegrass program in the same year. An emeritus board member of Bluegrass
  Pride\, Blount is known as a strong advocate for progressive causes withi
 n the music industry\, and appears regularly on conference panels pertaini
 ng to social and environmental justice. His writings on music and issues f
 acing the industry have appeared in publications including Rolling Stone\,
  NPR\, Paste Magazine and No Depression.\n\nBlount is also a skilled educa
 tor. In addition to his on-stage offerings\, his engagements frequently in
 clude lectures and presentations pertaining to both his original research 
 and the history of Black string band music. He has shared this work at Yal
 e University\, Berklee College of Music\, the Smithsonian Institution and 
 elsewhere. He also makes regular appearances at music camps\, most notably
  Earful of Fiddle Music & Dance Camp\, offering hands-on instruction in fi
 ddle and banjo. In the fall of 2023\, Blount will begin working toward a P
 h.D. in Musicology and Ethnomusicology from Brown University.

 Shorty pleading : “If you don’t want this lie to me\, you don’t even

 2\, winning his first Grammy for his work as both songwriter and featured 
 artist on childhood friend and Album of the Year winner’s Jon Batiste’

 Stevie Wonder\, Dave Matthews\, Jonas Brothers and Little Big Town\, and i
 s hosting his Treme Threauxdown event for a sixth time on April 30 at the

 ir before that. After Jazz Fest\, Shorty will bring his once-in-a-lifetime
  Voodoo Threaxdown tour featuring Tank and the Bangas\, Big Freedia\, Cyri
 l Neville the Uptown Ruler and The Soul Rebels across the US. The tour wil
 l also feature a tribute to the foundational work of funk pioneers The Met
 ers led by founding bassist George Porter Jr. alongside Dumpstaphunk. The 
 Voodoo Threauxdown tour is a lesson in New Orleans music history\, and a v
 ision of where that music is headed in the 21st century. The festival will
  kick off on June 10 and will move across the US\, making stops at NYC’s
  Central Park Summerstage on June 13\, Red Rocks Amphitheater on June 28\,

 ews\\) is a native of New Orleans’ Tremé neighborhood and got his start
  earlier than most\, performing at Jazz Fest with Bo Diddley at age four a
 nd leading his own brass band at six. Since 2010\, he’s released four ch

DESCRIPTION:Creed Bratton's story has always been a music story\, but a re
 lentless drive for success and a stroke of luck led him down an entirely d
 ifferent path in Scranton\, PA. Now\, as he prepares to release his 10th s
 tudio album\, *Tao Pop*\, on September 27\, Bratton cements his place in 
 music history as he blissfully explores his many interpretations of pop mu
 sic.\n\n*Tao Pop* marks Creed’s fifth time working with multiple Grammy 
 Award-winning producers Dave Way (Michael Jackson\, Fiona Apple) and Dillo
 n O’Brian (Keith Urban\, Brian Wilson\, Ringo Starr). To collaborate on 
 four individual tracks\, he brought in longtime friends Billy Harvey\, Geo
 ff Pearlman\, Vance DeGeneres\, and Dillon O’Brian.\n\nThe album’s art
 work was inspired by Ray Kurzweil’s *The Singularity Is Near*\; after r
 eading it\, Creed envisioned the image while meditating\, imagining a worl
 d where AI-bots and humans coexist seamlessly. In this dream\, Creed is th
 e last human standing\, thriving in a world dominated by robots and AI—a
  poignant metaphor for his enduring presence in the music world.

 N:   Saturday\, September 7\, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell
  and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate
  the show.  Refreshments will be served.\n\n**Sonoma County artist\, Mars
 ha Connell\,** presents **Tidal Effects\,** new oil paintings from obser
 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t
 he California Arts Council\, Connell held leadership roles and participate
 d for years in Art Trails Open Studios\, Art at the Source\, and this year
 ’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collecte
 d at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.
 \n\nMeet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and Se
 ptember 8\, 11 am – 6 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Small Works Showcase presents
  **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**\, a collection of watercolor and go
 uache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the a
 rtist’s attention.  From Carmel\, to France to the Swiss Alps\, no airl
 ine ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing 
 coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fisherme
 n stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. \n\nMeet the
  Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 a
 m to 6 pm. \n\n**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Ga
 llery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident\, she is inspired by its quinte
 ssential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses 
 on flowers\, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa
  JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely 
 colorful\, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at
  the Gallery.\n\n**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14\, 5:30 – 7:30 p

DESCRIPTION:FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 8/15/24\n\n**SEPTEMBER EXHIBIT: TIDAL EF
 FECTS** \n\nEXHIBIT DATES: AUGUST 26 – SEPTEMBER  22\, 2024\n\nRECEPTIO
 N:   Saturday\, September 7\, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell
  and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate
  the show.  Refreshments will be served.\n\n**Sonoma County artist\, Mars
 ha Connell\,** presents **Tidal Effects\,** new oil paintings from obser
 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t
 he California Arts Council\, Connell held leadership roles and participate
 d for years in Art Trails Open Studios\, Art at the Source\, and this year
 ’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collecte
 d at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.
 \n\nMeet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and Se
 ptember 8\, 11 am – 6 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Small Works Showcase presents
  **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**\, a collection of watercolor and go
 uache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the a
 rtist’s attention.  From Carmel\, to France to the Swiss Alps\, no airl
 ine ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing 
 coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fisherme
 n stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. \n\nMeet the
  Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 a
 m to 6 pm. \n\n**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Ga
 llery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident\, she is inspired by its quinte
 ssential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses 
 on flowers\, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa
  JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely 
 colorful\, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at
  the Gallery.\n\n**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14\, 5:30 – 7:30 p

DESCRIPTION:Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experie
 nce needed\, all are welcome!!\n\nThis group is more than one individual a
 nd is held by volunteers\, if you are interested please contact through th
 e information below.\n\nArt therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no
  matter what we are going through in life\, we still have the ability to c
 reate and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life 
 experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into the
 rapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going o
 n internally. In that way\, we can come back to pieces that represent spec
 ific times in our life!\n\n- sonni king\n\nWe all need means of expression
  and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible wa
 y to heal.\n\nThere are so many things and burdens we carry in life\, and 
 not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a s
 pace where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating someth
 ing is beautiful\, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we l
 earn about that feeling from a different perspective.\n\nArt therapy will 
 include art supplies\, group grounding and group sharing\, feel free to br
 ing unfinished projects\, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone wh
 o wants to volunteer their time\, donate\, guide the group\, or have any q
 uestions should contact me here:\n\n707-396-9318\n\nOr contact Arlene Fran
 cis center\n\nThank you so much and I'm very excited to continue the gathe
 rings that Sonni originally created.\n\n- Angelica Gude

 orary urgency—that refuses such easy classification. The group’s influ
 ences are easy to pinpoint—Chuck Berry\, Eddie Cochran\, Carl Perkins et
 c. But the group also recalls Freddie King\, Bo Diddley\, Link Wray and of
  course 1950's rockabilly. The music speaks to fans across the musical spe
 ctrum.

 a show unlike any you've ever seen. Stylistically unique and captivating\,
  Ellie James mixes lush indie-pop sounds with the style and edge of her ro
 ck ’n’ roll background. Her music is both genuine and dance-inducing\,
  as she uses real instruments and electronic production to weave musical s
 tories all her own. Ellie has been performing professionally all over the 
 world for more than 10 years\, most recently opening up for Grammy-winning
  artist Colbie Caillat\, and playing to electric audiences at Hollywood’
 s famous Viper Room and San Francisco’s Cafe du Nord. With the release o
 f her much-anticipated sophomore EP “Favorite Stranger” and a nearly s
 old-out headlining show at Hopmonk\, Ellie shows no signs of stopping with
  a year ahead full of new shows\, new merch\, and new music.

DTEND:20240908T065800Z
UID:240814eFrIbX-lFUeldn_Cbd8zdg
DESCRIPTION:Born and raised in the Fillmore District of San Francisco\, An
 dre Nickatina has been a Hip-Hop/Rap luminary since the release of his cri
 tically acclaimed debut\, The New Jim Jones. A favorite at public venues a
 nd on college campuses\, Andre Nickatina continues to sustain a loyal fan-
 base\, while engaging new supporters throughout North America. Nickatina
 ’s classic stage show combined with his rare interviews\, maintains his 
 mystery and unique musicianship that has spanned two decades.\n\nThe longe
 vity of Nickatina speaks for itself. An award-winning MC and producer (200
 5 Bay Area Artist of The Year / Album of The Year for Bullets)\, Nickatina
 ’s vision has expanded beyond the 18 albums (and hundreds of thousands o
 f sales) that he has executive-produced. Also\, a diverse artist\, Nickati
 na has gained critical acclaim for his work and vision as a filmmaker\, wi
 th more than seven films to his credit as either a director\, co-director\
 , executive producer\, producer or actor.\n\nChanging his name from Dre Do
 g to Andre Nickatina in 1996\, he transformed his career to a plateau that
  has allowed him to create and develop an entirely new fan base with his o
 riginal flow\, distinct voice and lyrical explorations that few other MCs 
 have displayed an ability to achieve. His third album\, Raven In My Eyes\,
  marked Nickatina’s shift as an artist and expanded his audience to the 
 wildly enthusiastic college crowds that praise him with regular sellouts f
 rom coast to coast. In 2008 Nickatina completed a timeless masterwork that
  paired he and his friend\, Mac Dre (R.I.P.) together with the new classic
 \, A Tale of Two Andres.\n\nNickatina’s business acumen is as sharp and 
 honorable as his presence on stage. Nickatina’s vision as an artist has 
 been admired by many of his peers as he is seen as one of the last Bay Are
 a Legends who was not only present during the golden-era of Hip-Hop\, but 
 one of the few artists who has helped Hip-Hop grow and who has remained ul
 timately relevant with each successive album he has released. Without say
 ing so\, Nickatina has had his finger on the pulse of what is raw\, uncut 
 and capable of capturing the mind and ears of listeners. Never one to foll
 ow or ride trends\, Andre Nickatina is a rare breed of artist… one of th
 e last original trend setters. Nickatina does not do what the people want
 … rather the people want to know what Dre will do next.

UID:240901IpnirWA2lkure9yyhciZGw
DESCRIPTION:Raised on TV is an indie rock band from the San Fernando Valle
 y in Los Angeles\, CA\, that was formed by brothers Keaton Rogers and Kace
 y Greenwood in 2016. They have toured and played numerous venues and festi
 vals \\(Deep Ellum Fest\, Mesa Music Fest\, Topanga Days\, Abbott Kinney\,
  Whole Earth Festival\\) all across North America\, and have opened for es
 tablished bands such as Jefferson Starship\, Marcy Playground\, Sponge\, a
 nd Green Jello. They embrace the wildly varying and fun nature that comes 
 with being an indie rock band\, playing a giant festival stage one night\,
  and a backyard college party the next.\n\n \n\nBack in 2017\, their firs
 t album “Season 1” charted on the NACC top 200 \\(one of few albums fr
 om unsigned bands to do so\\) and was described by NoGossipLA.com as “gr
 ooving from one track to the next with a familiar kick-assery that reminds
  us that blink-182 disciples are alive and well.” The band wanted to mak
 e an indie rock statement\, recording the whole album in just three days\,
  mostly with everyone playing in the same room. The lead single from the a
 lbum\, “Big Sur” helped establish the band’s dreamy California rock 
 sound with PuregrainAudio.com describing it as “an easy-breezy \\(and 
 yes\, beautiful - what up\, cover girl!\\) mix of alternative\, rock and i
 ndie.” In a beaten up van\, they toured up and down the west coast and a
 ll throughout the Southwest. They would end up driving that van into the g
 round\, needing to abandon it after a show in Las Vegas.  \n\n \n\nTheir
  second album\, “Season 2\,” a more polished effort\, was recorded mos
 tly at Dave Grohl’s 606 studio in Los Angeles\, and the first single “
 Caroline” got picked up by some Spotify editorial playlists\, being desc
 ribed by Soundsphere Magazine as a “wonderfully fuzzy\, constantly build
 ing alternative rock banger of a tune – melodic in a similar vein to Sil
 versun Pickups.”  “Soul on Fire”\, the second single from the album
  was described by EarMilk as having “powerful jangly guitars and throbbi
 ng drums. The highly contagious roaring rock track details finding yoursel
 f in the digital age.” Season 2 opened some doors for the band. They wer
 e featured by LA Weekly\, got to play “Jam in the Van\,” and were able
  to get a new van of their own \\(replacing the beaten up one that broke d
 own in Las Vegas.\\) They have since used that van to play everywhere poss
 ible\, getting out to the East coast for the first time in the summer of 2
 019 for a national tour that was sponsored by the Firestone Walker beer co
 mpany. A lot of early tour footage can be found in their music videos for 
 the songs "Old Journals" and "Soul on Fire."\n\n \n\nDuring the pandemic 
 they focused on recording\, and released singles and music videos all thro
 ughout 2021\, dropping their third studio album “Fernando” toward the 
 end of that year. One of those singles\, “In the Valley\,” helped them
  to be a featured artist of the week on Malibu’s KBUU 99.1 FM. JanglePop
  described the single as “mixing the crystalline jangly indie-pop of the
  Lost Ships with a subtle nod towards the indie-folk of The Decemberists.
 ” That summer\, they had the fortunate opportunity of being the backing 
 band in a music video for the one and only David Hasselhoff. \n\n \n\nTh
 e band has since gotten back to touring\, having released their fourth stu
 dio album\, "Strangers in Pictures” in 2023\, along with some new music 
 videos\, in collaboration with Sell the Heart Records. This marked their f
 irst release on vinyl!  The blog janglepophub.com described the album a
 s having “a juxtaposition of slightly ethereal\, spectral surf-rock that
  just about wins the fight for recognition amid the intermittent crunchy g
 uitar riffs that seem to want to break the act free from any sense of sacc
 harine.” 2023 was a jam packed year for the band\, playing close to 100
  shows\, touring most of the year\, and hosting monthly concerts at the ve
 nue Boomtown Brewery in Downtown LA. They have continued touring regionall
 y through 2024 playing the Mesa Music Festival and dozens of other venues 
 throughout California\, Arizona\, and Nevada. \n\n \n\nThey have been rel
 easing singles from their fifth album “Make Time to Make Time” which w
 as also released on Sell the Heart Records. The album was tracked at a hou
 se in Joshua Tree using a remote recording studio. The new album is now st
 reaming and a limited number of vinyl copies are available to order! The b
 and will continue to tour throughout 2024\, and they are beyond excited to
  be setting sail with an amazing lineup of bands and artists in February o
 f 2025 on Train’s “Sail Across the Sun” cruise!! \n\nContact: Raised

DESCRIPTION:"The Seed of McCoy" begins as a two-fisted tale of adventure o
 n the high seas.  The action takes place in French Polynesia\, visited by
  Jack and Charmian London during the Cruise of the Snark in 1907-1908.  L
 ike other London stories\, it is partly based on a true story. It was publ
 ished in Century magazine in 1907 and 1911 as part of the “South Seas Ta
 les.”\n\nStoryteller Jeff Falconer reads "The Seed of McCoy" aloud under
  the majestic oaks for a special Jack London morning.  A discussion and r
 efreshments follow the reading.\n\nMore than 100 years later\, the same ar
 ea was visited by Nancy and Rob Novak\, Sonoma County residents and real-l
 ife sailors who left on their cruise of a lifetime in 2012 that lasted 14 
 years. During that time\, unknowingly\, they visited the same area in Fren
 ch Polynesia and much more.  To continue the story and learn more about t
 heir adventures\, attend "The Story of the Snark and Cruise of the Shindig
 " on Sept. 28. Visit https://jacklondonpark.com/events/south-pacific-cruis

DESCRIPTION:**life into “Hallelujah.” She puts her indelible touch on 
 songs by Leonard Bernstein\, Randy Newman\, James  Taylor and more.** \n
 \n**In 2012\, she released the CD/DVD Judy Collins Live At The Metropolit
 an Museum Of Art which aired on PBS. This special television program was 
 nominated for a New York Emmy and won a Bronze Medal at the 2013  New Yor
 k Festival International Television & Film Awards. Based on it’s success
 \, in 2014 she filmed  another spectacular show in Ireland at Dromoland C
 astle. Live In Ireland was released in 2014. This  program also won a Br
 onze Medal at the 2014 New York Festival International Television & Film A

  has also authored several books\, including the powerful and inspiring\,
  Sanity & Grace and her  extraordinary memoir\, Sweet Judy Blue Eyes:
  My Life in Music. For her most recent title to be released in  2017\, 
 Cravings\, she provides a no-holds barred account of her harrowing strugg
 le with compulsive  overeating\, and the journey that led her to a solut
 ion. Alternating between chapters on her life and those of  the many diet
  gurus she has encountered along the way (Atkins\, Jean Nidtech of Weight 
 Watchers\, Andrew  Weil\, to name a few)\, Cravings is the culmination 
 of Judy's genuine desire to share what she's learned—so  that no one ha
 s follow her heart-rending path to recovery.** \n\n**In addition\, she rem
 ains a social activist\, representing UNICEF and numerous other causes. Sh
 e is the  director (along with Jill Godmillow) of an Academy Award-nomin
 ated film about Antonia Brico – PORTRAIT  OF A WOMAN\, the first woman
  to conduct major symphonies around the world–and Judy's classical piano
   teacher when she was young.** \n\n**Judy Collins\, now 77\, is as crea
 tively vigorous as ever\, writing\, touring worldwide\, and nurturing fres
 h talent.  She is a modern day Renaissance woman who is also an accompli
 shed painter\, filmmaker\, record label  head\, musical mentor\, and an 
 in-demand keynote speaker for mental health and suicide prevention. She 
  continues to create music of hope and healing that lights up the world a
 nd speaks to the heart.**

DESCRIPTION:Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experie
 nce needed\, all are welcome!!\n\nThis group is more than one individual a
 nd is held by volunteers\, if you are interested please contact through th
 e information below.\n\nArt therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no
  matter what we are going through in life\, we still have the ability to c
 reate and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life 
 experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into the
 rapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going o
 n internally. In that way\, we can come back to pieces that represent spec
 ific times in our life!\n\n- sonni king\n\nWe all need means of expression
  and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible wa
 y to heal.\n\nThere are so many things and burdens we carry in life\, and 
 not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a s
 pace where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating someth
 ing is beautiful\, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we l
 earn about that feeling from a different perspective.\n\nArt therapy will 
 include art supplies\, group grounding and group sharing\, feel free to br
 ing unfinished projects\, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone wh
 o wants to volunteer their time\, donate\, guide the group\, or have any q
 uestions should contact me here:\n\n707-396-9318\n\nOr contact Arlene Fran
 cis center\n\nThank you so much and I'm very excited to continue the gathe
 rings that Sonni originally created.\n\n- Angelica Gude

 and stories that I was not able to include in the blog due to space limita
 tions (and my exhaustion) that you might find interesting.\n\nThe focus of
  the presentation will be to give you a snapshot of what it's like to live
  in a country at war\, both in relatively safe areas as well as near the f
 ront lines of the war. What you see and read in the news are often sensati
 onal and newsworthy events. I try to show you what the ordinary Ukrainian 
 copes with on a daily basis. I will also share with you the stories of bra
 ve\, heroic and compassionate Ukrainians who are devoting their lives to t
 ry and meet the needs of struggling Ukrainians who either live near the fr
 ont lines of the war or who fled and are displaced throughout the country.
 \n\nPlease spread the word and invite your friends and neighbors. If you k
 now of any Ukrainians\, please invite them as the presentation will be tra
 nslated into Ukrainian.\n\nHere is the link to my blog: https://open.subst

  charge. However\, if you are so moved\, you will be given the opportunity
  to donate cash\, write a check or donate by credit card as you leave the 
 presentation. Every dollar will go to the organizations that I volunteered

DESCRIPTION:“California native Frankie Bourne combines the style of new 
 Americana with all the things you loved about 90s adult alternative bands.
 ”\n\n— Ryan Clark\, TourWorthy.com\n\nProlific singer-songwriter and i
 ndie darling Frankie Bourne is a recording artist and performing artist fr
 om the San Francisco Bay Area known for his rootsy\, emotionally-evocative
  songwriting and melodic harmonica playing. Rooted in classic rock and the
 mes of California soul\, his music blends the tones of Americana with the 
 spirit of indie rock to produce a sound that is as authentic as it is fami
 liar.  \n\nAs a solo performer he has made a name for himself in the Napa 
 and Sonoma wine country scene as a professional musician at wineries\, hot
 els\, corporate events and weddings.  His original trio Frankie Bourne and
  the Wildcards perform regularly in and around the Bay Area.\n\nHe’s rel
 eased four solo albums\, 3 EPs\, multiple singles\, and has played the mai
 n stages at some of the most prominent festivals in Northern California’
 s wine country. As an aggressive performer he’s played over 700 live sho
 ws\, toured the west coast multiple times and has even performed at a TED 
 talk.  He recently won the North Bay Bohemian NorBay Award for Best Singer
 -Songwriter of 2021.  \n\nHis fourth studio album “Pay to Play” just r
 eleased in November 2022 to positive reviews and is now streaming everywhe
 re. The Sonoma Index-Tribune recently claimed it to be “a very good new 
 album and well worth a listen”\, complete with “solid and strong origi
 nal songs”.\n\nOn his 2020 album “Wildcards”\, Bourne found himself 
 not only writing and arranging but also making his debut as sole producer.
  Tracked with the original lineup of his Sonoma County band \\(Frankie Bou
 rne and the Wildcards\\) at legendary Prairie Sun Recording in Cotati\, CA
 \, his third studio album exhibits growth and polish to his craft through 
 a collection of rock and roll songs that blend alt-country and melodic alt
 -rock with his layered\, story-driven lyrical style. \n\nOn his 2015 acous
 tic-laced debut studio album\, “Californicana” \\(produced by Marc Dan
 zeisen\\)\, Frankie took a stance as a solo artist and emerged on the scen
 e with an authentic sound that has been well-received by indie\, rock and 
 americana radio stations nationwide. LA Weekly called it "a refreshing roo
 ts rock record for the 21st Century". He supported the record with a spora
 dically changing group of players in the LA club scene\, including keyboar
 dist Carey Frank \\(Tedeschi Trucks Band\, Social Distortion\\)\, saxophon
 ist Jeremy Trezona \\(Saint Motel\\)\, bassist Andrew Perusi \\(Hanson\\)\

 emuestra ser más de lo que imaginaban. Los José tropiezan con ellos mism
 os y entre ellos tratando de conquistarla con su carisma y talento. Su div

DESCRIPTION:**$12** General Admission\n\n**Doors at 7:30pm.**\n\n**Show fr
 om 8:15-10:30pm with one intermission**\n\nA musical showcase of two coupl
 es featuring sweet harmonies and captivating original songs\n\n**The Strid
 erFactor** (Jon Strider and Robin Factor). \n\nOriginally from the SF Bay
  Area\, Jon spent 16 years in the music trenches of LA before emigrating t
 o Sweden in 2001\, where he forged a music career that includes nine solo 
 albums\, two hit songs on Swedish National Radio\, and widespread airplay 
 throughout Europe. Jon's original songs connect deeply with listeners on t
 hemes such as love’s loss & fulfillment and the immigrant’s journey. H
 e joined forces with life-long Sonoma County resident Robin in 2020. Their
  song 'In the days of Quarantine\,' co-written and recorded during the C\;
 ovid lockdown\, was favorably received on local and Swedish airwaves. They
  divide their time between Malmö Sweden and Forestville CA.\n\nhttps://ww

  http://www.jonstrider.com/ https://jonstrider.bandcamp.com/\n\n**Lindal
 ou and Michael Ryge** Sweetness\, compassion\, and a deep connection with 
 the natural world infuse the songs of Lindalou and Michael\, high school s
 weethearts who’ve been making music together since 1973. With beautifull
 y blended harmonies and inventive lyrics they describe their life in the r
 ugged hills above Calistoga\, and their encounters with the modern world. 
 Their job for the past several years is playing in elder care facilities w
 here they mostly play old familiar standards and get folks singing along. 
 Their first album 'Beginner's Luck' was released in 2003\\[\, and a 2nd al
 bum is in the works. These troubadours rarely perform in a showcase settin
 g\, so don’t miss this opportunity to experience the wit\, sparkle and e
 motional depth of their music.\n\nhttps://lindalouandmichael.net/ https:/

 m with one intermission     A musical showcase of two couples featuring sw
 eet harmonies and captivating original songs     The StriderFactor \\(Jon 
 Strider and Robin Factor\\).      Originally from the SF Bay Area\, Jon sp
 ent 16 years in the music trenches of LA before emigrating to Sweden in 20
 01\, where he forged a music career that includes nine solo albums\, two h
 it songs on Swedish National Radio\, and widespread airplay throughout Eur
 ope. Jon's original songs connect deeply with listeners on themes such as 
 love’s loss & fulfillment and the immigrant’s journey. He joined force
 s with life-long Sonoma County resident Robin in 2020. Their song 'In the 
 days of Quarantine\,' co-written and recorded during the C\;ovid lockdown\
 , was favorably received on local and Swedish airwaves. They divide their 
 time between Malmö Sweden and Forestville CA.  https://www.youtube.com/@j

 Sweetness\, compassion\, and a deep connection with the natural world infu
 se the songs of Lindalou and Michael\, high school sweethearts who’ve be
 en making music together since 1973. With beautifully blended harmonies an
 d inventive lyrics they describe their life in the rugged hills above Cali
 stoga\, and their encounters with the modern world. Their job for the past
  several years is playing in elder care facilities where they mostly play 
 old familiar standards and get folks singing along. Their first album 'Beg
 inner's Luck' was released in 2003\\[\, and a 2nd album is in the works. T
 hese troubadours rarely perform in a showcase setting\, so don’t miss th

DESCRIPTION:Steven Siro Vai \\(born 6th June\, 1960 in Carle Place\, New Y
 ork\\) is a Grammy Award winning guitarist\, composer and record producer.
 \n\n \n\n When growing up\, the young Vai became interested in rock giants
  such as Jimi Hendrix\, Frank Zappa\, Alice Cooper \\(Glen Buxton\\) and J
 immy Page leading him to take up the guitar. Prior to attending Berklee Co
 llege of Music\, Steve frequently jammed with his teacher Joe Satriani and
  played in numerous local bands. He has acknowledged the influence of many
  guitarists\, including Jeff Beck\, fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth and\
 , of course\, Zappa.\n\n \n\n Steve's career was launched by his fascinati
 on with Zappa's music. A persistent rumour at Berklee tells how Steve woul
 d skip classes\, spending time in the school's library transcribing Zappa'
 s works by ear. Steve mailed transcriptions of Zappa's guitar solos to him
 \, and after meeting Vai for the first time Zappa was so impressed with th
 e abilities of the young musician\, he hired him to transcribe his seeming
 ly endless array of experimental symphonic rock. In these formative stages
  of his career\, Vai's talent was showcased on such songs as &quot\;Moggio
 &quot\; and &quot\;Stevie's Spanking&quot\;.\n\n \n\n While employed by Za
 ppa\, Vai would at times tour with Zappa's band and engage in a friendly c
 ompetition with the audience\, wherein audience members could bring in mus
 ical scores and see if Vai could sight-read them on the spot\; Steve Vai i
 s also known to have perfect pitch. Zappa referred to Steve as his &quot\;
 little Italian virtuoso&quot\;\; he was listed in liner notes as &quot\;st
 unt guitarist&quot\;. Steve's transcription skills can be seen in 'The Fra
 nk Zappa Guitar Book'\, a collection of transcribed solos released in 1983
 . \n\n \n\n After leaving Zappa in 1982 he moved to California where he re
 corded his first album &quot\;Flex-Able&quot\; and performed in a couple o
 f bands. In 1984 he replaced Yngwie Malmsteen as lead guitarist in Alcatra
 zz with whom he recorded the album &quot\;Disturbing the Peace&quot\;.\n\n
  \n\n Later in 1985 Vai joined former Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth's 
 newly assembled group \\(which also featured acclaimed bassist Billy Sheeh
 an and drummer Gregg Bissonette\\) to record the multi-platinum albums &qu
 ot\;Eat'em And Smile&quot\; and &quot\;Skyscraper&quot\;. These albums\, a
 long with their accompanying videos and arena tours\, significantly enhanc
 ed Vai's reputation and popularity. At the time\, Roth engaged in a war of
  words with the members of Van Halen\; many commentators favorably compare
 d Vai's guitar-playing to Eddie Van Halen's.\n\n \n\n Following 1988's pop
 ular Skyscraper Tour\, Vai left David Lee Roth's band. In 1989 Vai stepped
  into guitarist Adrian Vandenberg's shoes to record with British rock-grou
 p Whitesnake after Vandenberg injured his wrist shortly before recording w
 as due to begin for the album &quot\;Slip of the Tongue&quot\;.

DESCRIPTION:LLEAGLES – The premier tribute to the music of the Eagles\n\
 nWhat do people want when they go see a live band? The members of SF Bay A
 rea based tribute band ILLEAGLES believe that everyone in the crowd wants 
 to be engaged and captivated from the first note until the show is done. O
 ver the past year and a half of sold out performances\, that is exactly wh
 at every crowd has gotten.\n\nILLEAGLES was founded in late 2016 when 6 fr
 iends came together who all had 2 things in common: 1) they loved the musi
 c of the Eagles\, and 2) each member was an amazing musician in their own 
 right. This common vision led to hours and hours of studying\, rehearsing\
 , and mastering each of the Eagles classic hits.\n\nFrom rockers Life in t
 he Fast Lane and Heartache Tonight\, to swooning ballads Desperado and Bes
 t of My Love\, ILLEAGLES not only reproduce the soaring guitars\, multi-pa
 rt harmonies and tightness of the original band\, but also add their own b
 rand of swagger and energy that keeps fans coming back over and over. It
 ’s commonplace for a majority of the audience to start singing along on 
 the first song\, and continuing to sing until the show is over (or they lo
 se their voices).\n\n*ILLEAGLES- A high energy\, unforgettable party that 
 leaves fans wanting more…*

 ” to star as Roz the bailiff. 1982 finalist Kevin Pollak has achieved a 
 major film career\, as has 1987 finalist Rob Schneider. Two first runners 
 up\, Ellen DeGeneres in 1985 and Mark Curry in 1989\, landed their own TV

DESCRIPTION:Fundado en 1995 en la tierra caliente de Aguililla\, Michoacá
 n\, el grupo Raza Obrera da inicio a su carrera en el genero Regional-Mexi
 cano\, con sus integrantes Jose Luis Arroyo\, Roberto Gonzalez “ Gurrumi
 no”\, Jose Luis Horta\, Hugo Pedraza y Mario Madrigal. Durante sus 14 an
 os de Carrera\, han grabado 14 materiales de los cuales recibieron  5 disc
 os de Oro y Cuatro de Platino.  Tras una breve ausencia\, Raza Obrera entr
 a al estudio a grabar 2 discos 1 de Corridos  y 1 de Canciones en el que s
 aldrá un Bonus Track\, grabado con la agrupación de Azul Azul\, “EL RA
 ZATON”   En esta nueva propuesta musical el grupo demuestra su versatili
 dad y autenticidad al reactivar los corridos pesados con arreglos bravíos
  y encabezados por la dulce\,embriagadora melodía del arpa\, el sello pri
 mordial de Raza Obrera mismo que  fucionaron al integrar el sonido de la T
 uba.   El nombre de Raza Obrera es el tributo que sus integrantes rinden a
 l pueblo como agradecimiento por comprar sus discos o asistir a sus bailes
 . Asimismo\, vale la pena mencionar que todos los integrantes del grupo so
 n hijos de campesinos y se criaron en el campo.  "Nunca hemos tenido apoyo
  económico. Lo que hemos logrado es lo que el pueblo nos ha dado. De ahí
  sacamos el nombre. Es un honor tener este nombre. Es representar a la gen
 te que emigró y está en Estados Unidos y nos referimos a quienes se vini
 eron de cualquier país a buscar una vida mejor. Esta es gente golpeada\, 
 que ha sufrido por estar fuera de su tierra. A ellos tratamos de llevarle 
 alegría”\, comentaron los integrantes del grupo.  Alegre en su planteam
 iento musical y únicos en su género\, Raza Obrera se distingue notableme
 nte de los otros grupos en la onda Regional-Mexicana tanto por la comicida
 d y originalidad de sus temas\,  como por la exhuberancia de sus energéti
 cas presentaciones.  El sabor alegre y explosivo de su sonido es indudable
 mente la marca registrada del grupo\, el cual cimienta sus raíces en el u
 so incondicional del arpa clásica\, el charango boliviano y el acordeón.
    Los integrantes de Raza Obrera siguen siendo los mismos que fundaron el
  grupo José Luis Arroyo\, en batería y voces\; Roberto “Tito” Gonzá
 lez “El Gurrumino”\, en el charango\; Simón Rivera “El Viejito hijo
  de la Corneta”\, en el arpa\, José Luis Horta\,” El Tortugo” en vo
 ces y acordeón y Hugo Pedraza en Teclado y Percuciones.Raza Obrera existe
  y funciona porque su propuesta musical es auténtica y su sencillez y hum
 ildad son genuinas. Son los iniciadores del movimiento Arpeno 1995 mezclan
 do el sonido con el charango.  Sus espectáculos son tan dinámicos que to
 dos sus elementos\, incluso los que tocan el charango y el arpa\, se mueve
 n\, se desplazan y bailan por todo el escenario\, llenando así el entorno
  que los rodea de una energía inexplicablemente contagiosa.  http://www.r

UID:240830G9-FRK_-mUqJuaGn16Yj7w
DESCRIPTION:Ever since Rock & Roll and Blues Hall Of Famer Elvin Bishop fi
 rst hit the scene with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band back in 1965\, he
 ’s blazed his own musical trail. Whether he was playing raw\, eye-poppin
 g blues\, or penning the evergreen radio hit Fooled Around And Fell In Lov
 e\, or touring the world for decades delivering his original\, good-time c
 ountrified blues\, Bishop has always inspired his fans with his rowdy guit
 ar playing and witty\, slice-of-life songs. Rolling Stone calls Bishop “
 a legendary guitarist” whose playing is “impeccable and spirited...a d
 istinguished American player.”  \n\nLate in 2015\, Elvin Bishop formed T
 he Big Fun Trio\, with Bishop on guitar and vocals\, and his friends Bob W
 elsh on piano and guitar and Willy Jordan on cajón \\(a hand-played Peruv
 ian drumbox\\) and vocals. After playing just a handful of live dates\, th
 e group’s instantly crowd-pleasing music and undeniable chemistry took t
 he blues world by storm. With the release of their self-titled CD in 2017\
 , media and fan response was immediate and overwhelming. DownBeat celebrat
 ed Bishop’s “verbal hijinks\, outstanding guitar work and country boy 
 friendliness.” OffBeat said The Big Fun Trio was “intricate\, funky an
 d uplifting\,” declaring them\, “consistently great.” With its top-s
 helf musicianship and front-porch vibe\, the album earned a Grammy Award n
 omination\, and won Blues Music Awards for Album Of The Year and Song Of T
 he Year \\(for the title track\\) from The Blues Foundation.  \n\nThe Big 
 Fun Trio quickly discovered the more they played live\, the more fun they 
 had making music together. So a follow-up recording was an easy decision. 
 The new album\, Something Smells Funky ‘Round Here\, finds the group fea
 rlessly laying it all on the line. According to Elvin\, “With a trio the
 re’s no place to hide­—you’ve got to be pourin’ everything you go
 t right out front. You need to be totally into it all the time. It’s rea
 lly cool to see how people react to the goin’-for-it feel of the music.
 ”  \n\nThe album mixes rousing\, new originals\, reinventions of three B
 ishop classics and some unexpected\, soul-shaking covers. Something Smells
  Funky ‘Round Here was produced by Bishop and Steve Savage and recorded 
 at Bishop’s Hog Heaven Studio in Lagunitas\, California. Bishop wrote or
  co-wrote five songs \\(including two by the entire trio\\). The potent ti
 tle track—a tongue-in-cheek State Of The Union address as only Elvin can
  deliver— kicks the album off with Bishop aiming his lyrical truths at t
 hose in power. The humorous but piercingly direct lyrics take aim at the c
 urrent political scene while Bishop’s deep blues guitar playing drives t
 he point home.   \n\nLookin’ Good finds Bishop autobiographically gazing
  in the rearview mirror with sharp\, wry lyrics accompanied by Welsh’s p
 erfect blues piano. Willy Jordan sings lead on four songs\, including blis
 tering reinventions of Jackie Wilson’s Higher And Higher and Ann Peebles
 ’ I Can’t Stand The Rain. Bob Welsh\, whose guitar or piano playing hi
 ghlight every song\, pounds the ivories on his own Bob’s Boogie. “This
  album fell together easily\,” says Bishop. “Everything I visualized a
 bout the songs—from Bob’s playing to Willy’s singing\, came true. Bo
 b and Willy are great musicians.”   \n\nAccording to San Francisco Bay n
 ative Jordan\, who has decades of experience playing drums with artists in
 cluding John Lee Hooker\, Joe Louis Walker and Angela Strehli\, playing in
  the Big Fun Trio is “crazy different. It’s rootsy but also new. We al
 l stayed simple to stay strong.” Welsh\, originally from Covington\, Lou
 isiana\, has performed and toured with Bishop\, Rusty Zinn\, Charlie Musse
 lwhite\, Billy Boy Arnold\, James Cotton and others. Welsh says he too lov
 es playing in the Trio. “Playing this music is fun and fresh and new to 
 us. It keeps us on our toes. We’re always surprising each other. We have
  to be fearless.”  \n\nBorn in Glendale\, CA on October 21\, 1942\, Bish
 op grew up on a farm in Iowa before relocating to Oklahoma when he was ten
 . He first got hooked on the blues listening to late night R&B radio as a 
 teenager\, and began collecting\, listening to and absorbing blues music. 
 Once Bishop realized that many of his favorite records were recorded in Ch
 icago\, he used his 1959 National Merit Scholarship as a way to get closer
  to his blues heroes by enrolling in the University of Chicago\, whose cam
 pus was located near dozens of the South Side clubs.\n\nAfter Elvin crosse
 d paths with harmonica player and fellow University of Chicago student Pau
 l Butterfield\, the two began sitting in together at South Side clubs\, of
 ten jamming with Buddy Guy and Otis Rush. They first formed The Paul Butte
 rfield Blues Band in 1963\, adding Jerome Arnold on bass\, Sam Lay on drum
 s and later Mark Naftalin on keyboards. Prior to cutting their debut LP in
  1965\, Michael Bloomfield joined the group as second lead guitarist\, cre
 ating a groundbreaking\, all-star band. The self-titled The Paul Butterfie
 ld Blues Band introduced electric Chicago blues to the rock audience for t
 he first time. With the release of East/West in 1966\, the band’s popula
 rity hit an all-time high. Their straight Chicago blues sounds drifted fur
 ther into progressive and experimental rock ‘n’ roll and—with two wo
 rld-class lead guitarists on board—the band helped pave the way for grou
 ps featuring multiple virtuoso guitarists\, like The Allman Brothers Band 
 and Derek and the Dominos. The band\, including Bishop\, was inducted into
  the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 2015.\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s\, a
 fter recording three albums with The Paul Butterfield Blues Band\, Elvin d
 ecided to move on\, heading for the San Francisco area. He became a regula
 r at the famed Fillmore Auditorium jam sessions\, playing alongside Jimi H
 endrix\, Eric Clapton\, B.B. King and many others before embarking on a so
 lo career. He recorded first for Fillmore Records\, then Epic and then for
  Capricorn\, where his career took off. He charted with Travelin’ Shoes 
 before scoring big in 1975 with Fooled Around And Fell In Love \\(the song
  reached number three on the pop charts and was prominently featured in th
 e blockbuster film\, Guardians Of The Galaxy\\). \n\nAfter a seven-year re
 cording hiatus\, Elvin returned to his blues roots in 1988\, signing with 
 Alligator and releasing five albums between 1988 and 2000. After a few rel
 eases on other labels\, Bishop returned to Alligator with 2014’s Can’t
  Even Do Wrong Right\, and once again turned the music-loving world on its
  head. Reviews poured in from NPR’s Fresh Air\, Rolling Stone\, Living B
 lues\, No Depression and many others. He appeared on TBS-Television’s CO
 NAN and performed numerous times on A Prairie Home Companion\, most recent
 ly with The Big Fun Trio.   \n\nWith Something Smells Funky ‘Round Here\
 , Elvin Bishop’s Big Fun Trio are clearly having a very good time. Havin
 g spent almost three years performing\, these three tremendously talented 
 musicians continue to inspire each other to new heights. As Elvin Bishop
 ’s Big Fun Trio take their music back on the road\, fans will once again
  have a chance to experience the big fun first hand. According to Living B
 lues\, “Elvin Bishop’s Big Fun Trio has wonderful chemistry and are a 
 joy to hear.”

 clear and quiet your mind. The uses of a labyrinth are many\; relief from 
 stress and anxiety\, healing\, meditation\, problem solving\, enhancing in
 tuition\, expanding thought processes\, communicating with the Divine\, ba
 lancing mind\, body and spirit\, letting go of unwanted energies\, obtaini
 ng goals\, celebrating and remembering others\, building trust in yourself
  or others\, and coping with grief\, sorrow and loss. The labyrinth is an 
 ancient symbol that relates to wholeness. It combines the imagery of the c
 ircle and the spiral into a meandering but purposeful path. The Labyrinth 
 represents a journey to our own center and back again out into the world. 
 Labyrinths have long been used as meditation and prayer tools.\n\nLooking

 world for more than 10 years\, most recently opening up for Grammy-winning
  artist Colbie Caillat\, and playing to electric audiences at Hollywood’
 s famous Viper Room and San Francisco’s Cafe du Nord. With the release o

DESCRIPTION:West County Fiddle Workshop \\(every 3rd Tuesday from 7-9 PM\\
 ) In this 2-hour workshop\, we'll dive into a new fiddle tune every month.
  American traditional fiddle music is vast\, with deep Celtic roots and a 
 fascinating multi-cultural history that gave birth to old-time music\, and
  later to bluegrass. Each month\, we'll work on a new tune from one of the
 se three genres. After learning the basic melody\, we'll explore the nuanc
 es that make each tune & style come alive. All stringed instruments and le
 vels are welcome\, but students should be comfortable enough on their inst
 ruments that they can learn bite-sized phrases of a melody by ear.  David 
 Pascoe is a singer and multi-instrumentalist based in Occidental\, CA. In 
 addition to being a passionate music educator and the co-founder of Every 
 Folk \\(a 3-day camp for adults to explore traditional music and culture\\
 )\, he performs with multiple groups up and down the West Coast on fiddle\
 , mandolin\, and guitar. He lives for the moment when music comes alive in
  the people around him. Workshop fee is $25\, $20 for OCA members.  Regist

DESCRIPTION:Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experie
 nce needed\, all are welcome!!\n\nThis group is more than one individual a
 nd is held by volunteers\, if you are interested please contact through th
 e information below.\n\nArt therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no
  matter what we are going through in life\, we still have the ability to c
 reate and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life 
 experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into the
 rapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going o
 n internally. In that way\, we can come back to pieces that represent spec
 ific times in our life!\n\n- sonni king\n\nWe all need means of expression
  and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible wa
 y to heal.\n\nThere are so many things and burdens we carry in life\, and 
 not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a s
 pace where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating someth
 ing is beautiful\, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we l
 earn about that feeling from a different perspective.\n\nArt therapy will 
 include art supplies\, group grounding and group sharing\, feel free to br
 ing unfinished projects\, ideas and be ready to create together. Anyone wh
 o wants to volunteer their time\, donate\, guide the group\, or have any q
 uestions should contact me here:\n\n707-396-9318\n\nOr contact Arlene Fran
 cis center\n\nThank you so much and I'm very excited to continue the gathe
 rings that Sonni originally created.\n\n- Angelica Gude

DTEND:20240920T020000Z

DESCRIPTION:The road to Strawberry Mansion\, which was recorded at Dayligh
 t Sound in Nashville with longtime compadres Paul DeFigilia \\(Avett Broth
 ers\\) and Mat Davidson \\(Twain\\)\, began in 2019 with Slim’s decision
  to get sober. Even though the singer-songwriter kicked alcohol years ago\
 , the insidious monster of addiction had crept back into his life in diffe
 rent guises. The last straw came during a road trip with a friend\, who\, 
 at the end of the journey\, let it be known that the man he knew and loved
  was no longer recognizable. So Slim called his manager and loved ones and
  soon checked into a program. That experience and his ongoing recovery pro
 gram have given him a framework for grappling with the personal demons tha
 t have always skulked in the shadows\, and helped him find light in the vo
 id. “It’s important for me to talk honestly about these things\, becau
 se I feel it gives me strength\, and it might help others along the way.
 ” he says.\n\nStrawberry Mansion is the singer-songwriter’s seventh fu
 ll-length album. He released his first record\, Electric Love Letter\, bac
 k in 2004. Since then he has graced the stages of Bonnaroo\, Lollapalooza\
 , Newport Folk Festival\, and the Conan O’Brien show\, winning fans over
  with his heart-on-a-sleeve sincerity and rousing live shows.\n\nBorn Sean
  Scolnick in 1980\, Slim took part of his artistic moniker from his hometo
 wn of Langhorne\, Pennsylvania\, a place he’s still very much connected 
 to despite making his home in Nashville. Since the advent of Covid-19\, he
  has been traveling back to PA once a month to see his mother and grandmot
 her\, and\, like many Americans\, finding strength in his origins and fami
 ly bonds. The title Strawberry Mansion refers to the neighborhood in Phila
 delphia where both of his grandfathers grew up\, a place he calls “dirty
  but sweet\, tough but full of love\, where giants roamed the earth and ha
 d names like Whistle and Curly.” That idea of a mythical wonderland info
 rms the new album from head to toe. Strawberry Mansion is not so much abou
 t nostalgia for the past as it is about the possibility of better days ahe
 ad in this world. These are songs that remind us we’re all part of a col
 lective “Mighty Soul\,” united in one journey\, just like the characte
 rs in that old Philly neighborhood. It’s a life-affirming album for thes
 e times.

  different backgrounds. Her catalogue includes cross-genre and multilingua
 l compositions like “Ana no potable\,” a song in Spanish dedicated to 
 a former mayor of Madrid\, “Dream\,” a tribute to musicals that sounds
  like it came straight from a Broadway production\, and the award-winning

 ncisco native has performed across the States and Europe\, was selected to
  appear at the 2024 National Women’s Music Festival\, and is an Art:Omi

DESCRIPTION:Stir together the sounds of R&B\, vulnerable singer-songwriter
 \, and Retro Soul\, and you've got Bay-Area based Tom Quell. His warm styl
 e has been likened to classic singers like Sam Cooke and Paul McCartney--a
 nd his voice could very well be an item in the dairy aisle\, time and agai
 n being described as creamy\, buttery\, and smooth. Tom's sound is steeped
  in vintage\, old-soul influences as well as a modern flair that speaks un
 iquely for itself.\n\n​\n\nBorn and raised near Seattle\, WA\, Tom's mus
 ical journey began as an elementary-age kid in his bedroom: listening to \
 \*NSYNC and Backstreet Boys on his walkman and memorizing every little nua
 nce in their voices.  As his taste began to develop toward 70s soul musi
 c over the years\, he picked up piano and guitar and started singing in ch
 oirs\, eventually leading to a spot in a collegiate a cappella group at UC
  Berkeley. Vocal harmony has always been at the forefront of Tom's style\,
  and it continues to serve as the bedrock for his songwriting and arrangem
 ents.

 able\,” a song in Spanish dedicated to a former mayor of Madrid\, “Dre
 am\,” a tribute to musicals that sounds like it came straight from a Br
 oadway production\, and the award-winning trip through U.S. racial and mus
 ic history “Hambone Says”.\n\nThe San Francisco native has performed a
 cross the States and Europe\, and was selected to appear at the 2024 Natio
 nal Women’s Music Festival. Her performances bring to life intricate\, r
 hythmic and emotional musical stories that are full of characters as raw\,
  confused and contradictory as we all are.

 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal

 ha Connell\,** presents **Tidal Effects\,** new oil paintings from obser
 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t

DESCRIPTION:The country simplicity that imbues Hayes Carll’s songs can s
 ometimes hide the social conscience and sharp humor that also runs through
  them\, but if you want to find those things\, they are there. In fact\, C
 arll has spent over 20 years having a conversation about what it is we’r
 e all doing here with anyone who will listen. He makes us laugh––but t
 hen he makes us cry. We judge a song’s protagonist\, only for Carll to s
 pin us around to commiserate with them.\n\n“I like to tug at heartstring
 s\, find commonality with others\, reflect on my own life\, and sometimes 
 I do it in a lighthearted way\,” says Carll. “A lot of musical styles 
 found their way onto this record\, but my first and most formative influen
 ces came from country music. This is a country singer-songwriter record. I
 t’s just unapologetically me.”\n\nCarll is talking about You Get It Al
 l\, his eighth album. His voice\, rich but worn\, has never sounded better
 . As a songwriter\, he is in top form\, turning droll confessions\, messy 
 relationships\, motel room respites\, and an exasperated\, hitchhiking God
  into modern nuggets.\n\nThe New York Times likened Carll’s ability to u
 ndergird humor with a weightier narrative to Bob Dylan. When Carll talks a
 bout the sounds that are in his own head\, he mentions Randy Travis. That 
 juxtaposition defines the singularity of Carll’s career: He exists in a 
 space of his own\, informed by John Prine\, Tom Waits\, and Dylan but also
  by Travis\, Kenny Rogers\, and Hank Williams\, Jr.\n\nThose influences ma
 y have made him hard to pigeonhole\, but he’s still been embraced. Two A
 mericana Music Awards\, a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song\, and mu
 ltiple Austin Music Awards line his resumé́. He’s had the most-played 
 record on Americana radio twice. His songs appear on the screen regularly 
 and have been recorded by Kenny Chesney\, Lee Ann Womack\, and Brothers Os
 borne\, to name a few.\n\nYou Get It All was produced by Allison Moorer an
 d guitar legend Kenny Greenberg. Carll credits his partnership with singer
 \, songwriter\, and artist Moorer\, his wife\, as a force that helps both 
 clarify what he wants and challenge self-imposed limits. “She’s a worl
 d-class artist who has a way of helping me articulate my vision\,” he sa
 ys.\n\nOpener “Nice Things” layers a laugh-out-loud narrative exposing
  humanity’s botched stewardship of Earth––and one another––over 
 vintage country cool. In the song written with the Brothers Osborne\, God 
 comes down to check on us––and she is not impressed. “It’s social 
 commentary\, but it’s not dour\,” Carll says. “I hope the song can m
 ake people sing along\, laugh a bit\, and maybe recognize that we can do b
 etter.”\n\nThe title track is classic Carll—a front-porch singalong wi
 th a deeper message for those who want it. Self-deprecating and sweet\, th
 e song is an ode to bringing one’s whole self to a relationship––the
  good and the bad. “I’m at a point in my life where that rings true to
  me\,” says Carll. “What I want\, and what I think a lot of people wan
 t\, is to feel like they’re getting the real thing.”\n\n“Help Me Rem
 ember” is a feat of storytelling that tackles an underrepresented topic 
 in art: dementia from the perspective of the patient. “It’s a visual s
 ong. To tell this story\, we had to put the listener right there\,” Carl
 l says. “I was thinking about how scary and sad it is for the person who
  is suffering from it\, and how heartbreaking and frustrating it is for th
 e friends and family going through it with them.”\n\nAmong Carll’s co-
 writers is singer-songwriter Brandy Clark\, who helped him pen and perform
  “In the Mean Time\,” a gorgeous\, honky-tonk waltz which perfectly de
 picts the damage couples can inflict on each other when they’re at their
  worst. The multi-dimensionality of relationships is a thread woven throug
 hout the entire album. “When we’re our weakest or most afraid\, real d
 amage can be done to our relationships\, as well as our spirits\,” says 
 Carll. “You can love somebody\, everything can be as good as you could
 ’ve imagined\, but when your traumas or fears come out\, all that love c
 an disappear in an instant.”\n\nRollicking through snarling 80s country 
 guitar licks\, “To Keep From Being Found” is an escape to a motel room
  with a TV on wheels\, a bath\, and line after delectable line.\n\nSubdued
  album closer “If It Was Up to Me” aches through a list of wishes that
  seem frivolous at first but build into a portrait of pain that’s far mo
 re complicated. Written with Moorer and Sean McConnell\, it’s a gorgeous
  example of one of Carll’s favorite artistic devices: leading listeners 
 to underestimate a character with whom they’ll ultimately empathize. “
 The way humor and sadness can work together is powerful\,” he says.\n\nH
 onest and sometimes subversive\, but never mean-spirited\, Carll keeps wri
 ting sad\, funny\, compelling songs in which nobody’s perfect or predict
 able––at least not for long. And he can’t quit wishing we’ll all r
 ealize that’s the way anything worth having or being has got to go. “I
  hope this record helps people feel good\, laugh a bit\, and maybe give th
 em something to lean on when they need it\,” he says. “I hope they dan

DESCRIPTION:Fleetwood Mask is the only tribute in the Americas endorsed by
  Fleetwood Mac founding member Mick Fleetwood. “This band does it right.
  I’m proud to know the music of Fleetwood Mac is in good hands indeed”
  says Mick in his video endorsements of the group.\n\nFleetwood Mask was f
 ounded over a decade ago to tribute one of the world’s greatest rock and
  pop bands and has been touring the U.S. every year since. Fans flock to e
 ach show because they are yearning for the ultimate in realism\, performan
 ce\, and sound quality. Fleetwood Mask has gone to unimaginable lengths to
  ensure each performer uses the correct and exact period-accurate equipmen
 t to deliver audiences with the most authentic tribute to Fleetwood Mac in
  the world. Some of Fleetwood Mask’s stage equipment is equipment that w
 as used by\, and toured with\, Fleetwood Mac.\n\nEach performers wardrobe 
 is further curated to era-specific specifications and most of the band’s
  wardrobe is bespoke\, hand made by artisans who have studied each era of 
 Fleetwood Mac’s stage wear in order to deliver stunning and detailed acc
 uracy.\n\nThis level of execution allows Fleetwood Mask the ability to tri
 bute the three most iconic Fleetwood Mac tours\, each one known by Fleetwo
 od Mac fans for having specific equipment\, wardrobe\, and set lists. Show
  attendees can expect to see either the Tusk tour 1980\, The Mirage tour 1
 982\, The Dance tour 1997\, and/or a mix of Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Historic 
 Best Of’. No one leaves a Fleetwood Mask concert without having a fully 
 immersive Fleetwood Mac experience.\n\nAn evening with Fleetwood Mask is l
 ike no other – two-set audiences are transported into the incredible ill
 usion of attending an actual Fleetwood Mac concert as the band performs bo
 th tour-specific and ‘Historic Best Of’ sets providing show attendees 
 a ‘double serving’ of the sights\, sounds\, and songs of Fleetwood Mac
 .\n\nAs Mick has always loved to quote Shakespeare...”then play on...”
  Fleetwood Mask is deeply honored to do so keeping access to the Fleetwood
  Mac live concert experience available to all.

 enues throughout Northern California with both new and devoted fans of the
 ir upbeat reggae rock music. They have established themselves as a powerfu

 ed by the sounds of ska\, dub\, and classic reggae\, this seven member pow
 erhouse is fronted by one of the most charismatic and energetic lead singe

 N:   Saturday\, September 7\, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell
  and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate
  the show.  Refreshments will be served.\n\n**Sonoma County artist\, Mars
 ha Connell\,** presents **Tidal Effects\,** new oil paintings from obser
 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t
 he California Arts Council\, Connell held leadership roles and participate
 d for years in Art Trails Open Studios\, Art at the Source\, and this year
 ’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collecte
 d at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.
 \n\nMeet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and Se
 ptember 8\, 11 am – 6 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Small Works Showcase presents
  **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**\, a collection of watercolor and go
 uache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the a
 rtist’s attention.  From Carmel\, to France to the Swiss Alps\, no airl
 ine ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing 
 coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fisherme

  Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 a
 m to 6 pm. \n\n**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Ga

 ssential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses 
 on flowers\, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa
  JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely 
 colorful\, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at

 N:   Saturday\, September 7\, 2024 4-6 pm: Meet artists **Marsha Connell
  and Tosya Shore** to hear about their artistic inspirations and celebrate
  the show.  Refreshments will be served.\n\n**Sonoma County artist\, Mars
 ha Connell\,** presents **Tidal Effects\,** new oil paintings from obser
 vation (en plein air) and memory recording the connections between seen an
 d unseen forces that shape the coasts of Northen California. Every day thi
 s landscape of water\, earth and air changes\, as does the artist\, and th
 e viewer.  Scenes move between representation and abstraction\, shifting 
 shape\, color\, edges\, pattern. “Dragons’ Veins” teems with vibrati
 onal forces - sand\, sun and shadow dance at the edge of the sea.  Lookin
 g down on the shore in “Ocean Never Rests” we are anointed with water\
 , taste the salt\, smell the sea\, the ocean pulsing\, breathing\, never r
 esting. Underneath are the San Andreas and sister faults\, Rogers Creek an
 d Mayacama\, connecting power spots with dragons’ veins\, keeping Santa 
 Rosa\, Ukiah\, the Bay area\, awake. Connell hopes that “My art be solac
 e and joy\, touch the heart and heal the soul – oases for the spirit in 
 this world of planetary crises.” \n\nMarsha Connell’s life as an arti
 st/teacher and artist-in-residence reflects a commitment to both personal 
 creative work and to the community. With a longtime base in the Santa Ros
 a Junior College’s Art Department\, she also taught at Sonoma State Univ
 ersity\, California Arts Project\, K-12 public and private schools\, and n
 umerous workshops. A grant recipient from the Pepperwood Foundation and t
 he California Arts Council\, Connell held leadership roles and participate
 d for years in Art Trails Open Studios\, Art at the Source\, and this year
 ’s new Santa Rosa Open Studios. Her work has been exhibited and collecte
 d at numerous galleries and venues across the country and internationally.
 \n\nMeet the Artist:   Connell will be hosting the Gallery Aug 28 and Se
 ptember 8\, 11 am – 6 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Small Works Showcase presents
  **Tosya Shore’s Captured Moments**\, a collection of watercolor and go
 uache paintings depicting the exciting eclectic places that captured the a
 rtist’s attention.  From Carmel\, to France to the Swiss Alps\, no airl
 ine ticket is needed to enjoy the quaint European backstreets or enticing 
 coastal scenes portrayed in these pieces.  In “On the Rocks” fisherme
 n stand on an outcropping enjoying a sunny day at the shore. \n\nMeet the
  Artist: **Shore** will be hosting the Gallery September 17 & 23 from 11 a
 m to 6 pm. \n\n**WECOME BEV HALEY** – new artist at the Upstairs Art Ga
 llery.  A lifelong Sonoma County resident\, she is inspired by its quinte
 ssential landscape.  Haley found her niche in acrylic paints and focuses 
 on flowers\, loving their beauty and simplicity. She studied at Santa Rosa
  JC and with master artists.  Haley exhibits regionally and her uniquely 
 colorful\, cheerful style is a welcome addition to the artists’ group at
  the Gallery.\n\n**SECOND SATURDAY ART WALK SEPTEMBER 14\, 5:30 – 7:30 p

 ed up a fair amount of comedy credits. The 30-year-old South Bay standup k
 nown for his quirky digressions and keen\, off-the-cuff observations—he'
 s been compared to Rory Scovel—has opened for a number of high-profile c
 omedians at Rooster T. Feathers and the San Jose Improv\, including Darren
  Carter\, Ron Shock and Marc Curry \\(Hanging with Mr. Cooper\\).\n\nAusti
 n Blaylock hails from the secret wine capitol of California\, a small town
  called Livermore. He performs stand-up all over the Bay Area\, but his fa
 vorite haunts are San Francisco and San Jose\, as well as being featured i
 n SF Sketchfest. He’s known for hosting and producing Super Stacked\, a 
 locally renowned comedy show in San Jose\, that was featured in the San Jo
 se Metro and Content Magazine. With a charming mix of self-deprecating and
  anecdotal humor\, Austin has a natural gift for warming up a crowd\, havi
 ng opened for touring acts like Laurie Kilmartin. On a given day\, you can
  find Austin working on comedy writing\, jamming on his guitar \\(he total
 ly knows Wonderwall\\)\, or hanging with his cat\, Gus.\n\nLoren Kraut is 
 awkwardly hilarious\, Loren’s unorthodox style of comedy juxtaposes play
 fulness with deeply dark humor. She turns grim subject matter\, like depre
 ssion and suicide\, on its ear\, presenting the bleakness of mental illnes
 s with unexpected wit and levity. Ever the outsider\, Loren gives us a gli
 mpse into her weird\, silly and often tragic world that\, in the end\, is 
 surprisingly life affirming.\n\nDvontre Coleman is a comedian based in Sa
 n Francisco\, CA. Growing up he moved a lot\, but the one thing he took wi
 th him everywhere was the ability to laugh. Now he just does that in front
  of strangers with a microphone.\n\nMikel Nordstrom is a standup comic an
 d producer based in the California Bay Area. He has performed at venues su
 ch as the Sacramento Punchline and Cobbs Comedy Club. Mikel has taken part
  in comedy festivals\, most recently at the 2022 Savage Henrys Comedy Fest
 ival. His unique voice and perspective creates for a memorable show.

 ed the top standup comedians who preform in clubs across California and th
 e country and brought them to Petaluma to make you laugh harder then you e
 ver have before in.\n\nYour headliner Derek Sheen is a cuddly mess of ins
 ecurities and a gifted\, one-of-a-kind storyteller. His ability to mine hu
 mor from the dark\, humid corners of the human condition has made him a cu
 lt favorite of comedy nerds around the globe.\n\nDespite a lack of televis
 ion or film credits\, he has amassed a pretty loyal fan base touring with 
 comedy legends \\(name-drop alert!\\) Brian Posehn\, Patton Oswalt and Jan
 eane Garofalo.\n\nDerek Sheen has released four critically acclaimed album
 s on Minneapolis based Stand Up! Records\, with Grammy Winning producer Da
 n Schlissel.\n\nAll four albums are available for streaming on Spotify and
  Apple Music right now!\n\nTyler Hinz is a Bay area favorite and has rack
 ed up a fair amount of comedy credits. The 30-year-old South Bay standup k
 nown for his quirky digressions and keen\, off-the-cuff observations—he'
 s been compared to Rory Scovel—has opened for a number of high-profile c
 omedians at Rooster T. Feathers and the San Jose Improv\, including Darren
  Carter\, Ron Shock and Marc Curry \\(Hanging with Mr. Cooper\\).\n\nAusti
 n Blaylock hails from the secret wine capitol of California\, a small town
  called Livermore. He performs stand-up all over the Bay Area\, but his fa
 vorite haunts are San Francisco and San Jose\, as well as being featured i
 n SF Sketchfest. He’s known for hosting and producing Super Stacked\, a 
 locally renowned comedy show in San Jose\, that was featured in the San Jo
 se Metro and Content Magazine. With a charming mix of self-deprecating and
  anecdotal humor\, Austin has a natural gift for warming up a crowd\, havi
 ng opened for touring acts like Laurie Kilmartin. On a given day\, you can
  find Austin working on comedy writing\, jamming on his guitar \\(he total
 ly knows Wonderwall\\)\, or hanging with his cat\, Gus.\n\nLoren Kraut is 
 awkwardly hilarious\, Loren’s unorthodox style of comedy juxtaposes play
 fulness with deeply dark humor. She turns grim subject matter\, like depre
 ssion and suicide\, on its ear\, presenting the bleakness of mental illnes
 s with unexpected wit and levity. Ever the outsider\, Loren gives us a gli
 mpse into her weird\, silly and often tragic world that\, in the end\, is 
 surprisingly life affirming.\n\nDvontre Coleman is a comedian based in Sa
 n Francisco\, CA. Growing up he moved a lot\, but the one thing he took wi
 th him everywhere was the ability to laugh. Now he just does that in front
  of strangers with a microphone.\n\nMikel Nordstrom is a standup comic an
 d producer based in the California Bay Area. He has performed at venues su
 ch as the Sacramento Punchline and Cobbs Comedy Club. Mikel has taken part
  in comedy festivals\, most recently at the 2022 Savage Henrys Comedy Fest
 ival. His unique voice and perspective creates for a memorable show.

 day\, they write with a reverence for the transformative capabilities of m
 usic\; “A song can recall a powerful memory or inspire someone to forgiv
 e a person they’ve been upset with—music has that power—and I try to
  be aware of what I put out in the world with my songs”. Meli’s aesthe
 tic has been best described as a mix of folk-rock and alt-rock with a spla
 sh of pop. Skillfully uniting boldness and delicacy across a rapidly expan

 tist who has overcome adversity as a queer person to rise as one of the mo
 st exciting up and coming musical artists of our time.\n\nHaving shared st
 ages with Brandi Carlile\, Amy Ray (Indigo Girls)\, and Kathryn Calder (Th

DESCRIPTION:Back to All Shows\n\nCrowded House\n\nTuesday\, September 24\,
  2024\, at 8:00pm\n\n$75\, $95\, and $129\n\nFor more than four decades\, 
 Crowded House leader Neil Finn has been on an evolving\, winding journey. 
 Crowded House’s mid-‘80s hits like “Don’t Dream It’s Over” and
  “Something So Strong\,” combined with albums like Woodface and Togeth
 er Alone\, set the standard for the period’s erudite jangle-pop while al
 ways pushing the band’s art forward. That creative spirit brings Finn an
 d his Crowded House bandmates to Gravity Stairs\, their first new release 
 since 2021’s Dreamers Are Waiting and eighth overall. \n\nProduced by th
 e band with Steven Schram\, the album shows Crowded House in its current i
 ncarnation — Finn\, Nick Seymour\, Mitchell Froom\, and Finn’s sons\,
  Elroy and Liam — as sharp as ever\, feeling musically adventurous and 
 still capable of reaching the staggering highs that have made them an inte
 rnational favorite. \n\nFinn’s resume bears that out. From joining his b
 rother Tim in the 80s artful pop band\, Split Enz\, to leading Crowded Hou
 se to his numerous solo efforts\, Finn’s varied body of work is connecte
 d by his knack for penning meticulous\, indelible melodies and impressioni
 stic lyrics that demand multiple listens. It’s earned him devoted fans a
 ll over the globe\, an Order of the British Empire honor\, and induction i
 nto the Australian Recording Industry Association’s Hall of Fame. \n\nAl
 l VIP packages purchased for Crowded House will go through a third-party w

  or exchanges. VIP packages will not be sold or managed through the Luther

DESCRIPTION:Creating art and gathering for all skill types- no art experie
 nce needed\, all are welcome!!\n\nThis group is more than one individual a
 nd is held by volunteers\, if you are interested please contact through th
 e information below.\n\nArt therapy is a space to remind ourselves that no
  matter what we are going through in life\, we still have the ability to c
 reate and come together. It's a safe space to express and behold our life 
 experiences without judgement. The intention of incorporating art into the
 rapy is to provide a visual and external representation of what is going o
 n internally. In that way\, we can come back to pieces that represent spec
 ific times in our life!\n\n- sonni king\n\nWe all need means of expression
  and gathering as a community to find creative outlets is an incredible wa
 y to heal.\n\nThere are so many things and burdens we carry in life\, and 
 not many chances to let them go. With art therapy I'm hoping to create a s
 pace where people can safely express and speak. The act of creating someth
 ing is beautiful\, and when we create a feeling outside of our bodies we l
 earn about that feeling from a different perspective.\n\nArt therapy will 
 include art supplies\, group grounding and group sharing\, feel free to br

 and intimate performances. Boasting four albums\, two of which soared to \
 \#14 on the iTunes charts in 2018 and 2020 and gained critical acclaim\, M

 r being completely crowdfunded by her passionate fanbase via Kickstarter\,
  an incredible accomplishment.\n\nAwards adorn Megan's career\, including

 op 10 out of 2\,500 as well as Top 10 placement in the John Lennon Songwri

 am music. But it's not just about music\; it's a genuine conversation betw
 een the artist and the listener. She wholeheartedly invites and engages in

DESCRIPTION:Have you ever been lured by the siren song to set sail for the
  South Pacific?  Learn about two couples who made it a reality\, Jack and
  Charmian London and Rob and Nancy Novak.\n\nFor Jack and Charmian London\
 , living and owning land near Glen Ellen was a way of escaping Oakland\, f
 rom the city way of life he called “the man trap.” But\, restless and 
 eager for foreign travel and adventure\, he and his wife\, Charmian London
 \, decided to build a ship\, the Snark\, and sail around the world\, seria
 lizing his adventure.\n\nNancy and Rob Novak\, Sonoma County residents and
  real-life sailors left on their cruise of a lifetime in 2012. During that
  time\, unknowingly\, they visited some of the London’s South Seas desti
 nations like the Society Islands \\(Tahiti\, Moorea\, Huahine\, Bora Bora 
 and Raiatea\\)\, 105 years after Jack London’s Snark came to call.\n\nJo
 in Nancy and Rob Novak for an enchanting afternoon as they recount their a
 mazing voyage. They will set the stage with a summary of Jack and Charmian
 ’s South Seas sailing adventures before sharing their personal story of 
 sailing their own 48 ft sailboat\, “Shindig” in the Mexican and South 
 Pacific waters for over a decade.\n\n“Our goal was to go on our own sail
 ing adventure. We had been sailing in the SF Bay for many years\, and our 
 sailboat Shindig was bought specifically for an offshore adventure.  We r
 esigned from our jobs\, and spent a year downsizing our belongings and  p
 utting the rest into storage. Our initial plan was to take 1-2 years off o
 f work\, and see where the winds would take us.  We thought we’d stay i
 n Mexico for a year\, and then possibly go across the Pacific Ocean to the
  South Pacific.  When we finished our adventure\, we had sailed over 14 y
 ears and covered 15\,000 nautical miles. “\n\nNote: Limited seating is a

DESCRIPTION:Ana Popovic was born in Belgrade in 1976. Her father first int
 roduced her to the blues\, through an extensive record collection and sess
 ions hosted at the family home. Ana took to the guitar and founded her fir
 st serious band at age nineteen. Within a year\, she was playing outside o
 f Yugoslavia and opening shows for American blues icons like Junior Wells.
  By 1998\, her band was doing 100 shows annually and appearing regularly o
 n Yugoslavian television. Her debut CD\, Hometown\, provided a first glimp
 se of her talents as a singer and guitarist.\n\n \n\n In 1999\, Ana reloca
 ted to the Netherlands to study jazz guitar. She quickly became a fixture 
 on the Dutch blues scene and soon ventured into neighboring Germany. With 
 Comfort to the Soul \\(2003\\)\, Popovic took her burgeoning career to the
  next level\, she delivered another diverse package of blues\, rock\, soul
  and jazz. The album makes one thing clear. Ana Popovic is not about recyc
 ling worn-out clichés. Her blues are fresh\, positive and genre-expanding
 .\n\n \n\n Ana Popovic is a veritable anomaly in the blues scene\, in prof
 essional circles she's also called the feminine Jimi Hendrix.\n\n \n\n www

 ut of an appreciation for storytellers John Hiatt and Rodney Crowell and s
 ongwriters like Neil Finn\, Chuck Prophet and Ron Sexsmith. I grew up in N
 orthern California.  My father would bring home garbage bags full of old 4
 5 records that I would rummage through all afternoon.  “Someone must hav
 e tossed them out of their collection.” I’d think..but\, there they we
 re in front of me and I needed them! There were some caked with garbage an
 d grime and others pristine without a single scratch. I would get excited 
 to drop the needle and hear what’s next. What a gift!\n\nYears later\, I
 ’d take a pilgrimage to Texas with two suitcases and $500 in the bank.  
 I used the time to cut my teeth among the open-mics and songwriters’ nig
 ht’s. Those type of shows were in abundance at the time I was around tow
 n\, I really got into listening to the other writers play and talk about m
 usic. “Live Music Capital of the World”\, Austin’s music scene yield
 ed a bounty of musical experiences that I can still draw on today.\n\nI li
 ve in Sonoma. Ca.  I stay busy as a singer-songwriter. I am grateful. \n\n

 crow: The Poems of Pineshadow Walking Scarecrow: The Poems of Pineshadow i
 s a dialogue with Hanshan\, the Chinese mountain hermit beloved for his br
 ief poems about life far away from court life in the early 7th century. Ab
 out thirteen hundred years after Hanshan\, an old man who is more scarecro
 w than active citizen of a community walks each day pondering some of the 
 same subjects that entertained the Chinese master.   Prartho Sereno  Starf
 all in the Temple In Prartho Sereno's poems\, the daily doesn't collide ag
 ainst the cosmic but collaborates with it. Writing with the eyes of a myst
 ic seeker whose heart is wise enough not to take itself too seriously\, th
 e poetry of Starfall in the Temple veers wondrously from scientific specul
 ation to natural delight\, from mathematical proof to child's play. More t
 han anything\, each poem is a little lesson on how to love properly-and ho
 w to love properly\, Sereno suggests\, is to learn to love all. ~ Dan Beac
 hy-Quick\, poet and translator of The Thinking Root   Biographies/Testimon
 ials Mark Tate is the author of three novels\, Beside the River\, its sequ
 el River's End \\(McCaa Books\, 2021\\)\, and Butterfly on the Wheel \\(Mc
 Caa Books\, 2022\\). He served for ten years on the Sonoma County Poet Sel
 ection Committee for the poets laureate of that county. His book of poems 
 Walking Scarecrow\, awarded the Blue Light Press Book of the Year\, was pu
 blished December 2023. He is a long-time resident of Sonoma County where h
 e lives with his wife\, Lori. Poet Laureate Emerita Terry Ehret said that 
 "alluding to the Tang poet Hanshan\, Tate writes\, "I use what remedy / Is
  at hand to save the world." Tate's depiction of a Zen tea ceremony midway
  through the collection offers a kind of ars poetica\, simultaneously desc
 ribing the ritual and his verses\, "bowing to every honored thing." Local 
 poet Sandra Anfang\, author of Finishing School: "Mark Tate's new volume o
 f poems is a microcosm of large-scale wisdom and beauty. Generously includ
 ing bits of conversations with the ancients - Basho\, Li Po\, and . . . Co
 ld Mountain." Prartho Sereno's most recent collection\, Starfall in the Te
 mple\, was published by Blue Light Press\, Fall 2023. Her four other full-
 length collections include Indian Rope Trick\, Elephant Raga\, Call from P
 aris\, and her illustrated Causing a Stir: The Secret Lives and Loves of K
 itchen Utensils\, all of which won national prizes. Poet Laureate Emerita 
 of Marin County \\(2015-17\\)\, MFA Syracuse University \\(2013\\)\, and R
 adio Disney Super Teacher \\(2005\\)\, Prartho attributes over four years 
 in an Indian ashram as her strongest creative influence\, but she also cre
 dits excursions into other art forms: counseling psychologist\, vegetarian
  cook\, mother of 2\, meditation and yoga instructor at Cornell University
 \, book and cover illustrator\, and amateur singer-songwriter. She was a P
 oet in the Schools for 21 years and currently teaches The Poetic Pilgrimag
 e: Poem-Making as Spiritual Practice online.  "The magnificent poems of Pr
 artho Sereno reground us in our bodies\, in the glistening syllables and s
 cenes surrounding us. They retune us to a tender\, more palpably luminous 
 world we would prefer to inhabit." ~ Naomi Shihab Nye Tagged: fall2024

DESCRIPTION:With a timeless sound that blends heavy soul and psych-rock\, 
 Monophonics have built a reputation over the past decade as one of the bes
 t live bands in the country. Led by singer Kelly Finnigan\, the band of ha
 s drawn on their colorful history — both their experiences as veteran to
 uring performers and as individuals growing up in the Bay Area — to crea
 te “It’s Only Us\,” their fourth release since 2012\, out on Colemin
 e Records. \n\n \n\nA reflection of what they see as the current state of 
 the world\, the record touches on difficult subjects such as broken relati
 onships\, mental health issues\, gun violence and power struggles\, all wi
 th an underlying message of unity\, resilience and acceptance. The band’
 s signature style of arrangement — leaning on warm textures\, thanks to 
 rhythm and horn sections whose reputations precede them — has been expan
 ded with top-notch production and creative instrumentation: a Mellotron\, 
 lap steel guitar\, harp and Moog all round out the Monophonics’ trademar
 k soul sound\, while Finnigan’s vocals are more powerful than ever. At t
 imes these tracks can feel classic\, as familiar as an old song you grew u
 p with\, while simultaneously raising questions about the state of music i
 n 2021 and what the future might hold.\n\n \n\n“It’s Only Us” is the
  sound of a group continuing to grow as songwriters\, musicians\, performe
 rs and people — reflecting on where they’ve been\, and pushing the bou
 ndaries of what’s possible in the years to come.

 ons\n\nThe Sonoma Community Center’s Movement: Collab Lab is a 4-month 
 series of dance experiments for curious artists. With support from the fac
 ilitator and fellow Collab Lab artists\, each participant will have a chan
 ce to design and lead a simple movement exploration. Open to any artist wh
 ose medium is movement\, or who seeks to inspire their art by working with
  bodies in space.\n\nIn our first Lab \\(August\\)\, we will focus on buil
 ding connection within the group through playful tasks that emphasize list
 ening\, reflection and collaboration. Participants will also use the Augus
 t Lab time to build a plan for exploring their dance-related curiosities.
  \n\nOver the course of the following Labs \\(September – November\\)\,
  we will each take one turn engaging the group in our dance experiments. E
 xamples include\, but are not limited to: group movement improvisations\, 
 performing existing solo material for feedback\, posing questions for disc
 ussion\, or cross-pollinating dance with other art forms.\n\nEach Lab will
  include an accessible movement warm-up and a short snack break. Wear comf
 ortable layers\, and be prepared to move without street shoes \\(bare feet
 \, socks\, clean sneakers or dance shoes are allowed\\).\n\nPlease share a
 ny special considerations \\(medical\, physical\, learning\\) that will he
