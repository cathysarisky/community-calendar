 fun races on the west coast. This year marks the 20th anniversary of this 
 exciting people-powered boating race. \nThe event is open to practically a
 ny rowed or paddled craft\, and is a joy to witness from shore\, too!\nThe
  race can be viewed from Petaluma River Park (start/finish)\; along the ri
 ver trail through Alman Marsh (from the Sheraton) and from the lookout at 
 Shollenberger Park and along the riverside portion of Shollenberger trail.
  Gilardi's Lakeville Marina is a good place to view the half-marathon turn
 around as well as marathoners as they head out and back. Sundrop Sauna now
  has a semipermanent sauna and plunge at Gilardi's (book a session online)
 \, and there is a picnic table and restroom at this location too. \nNote: 
 The North Bay Rowing Club boatyard is NOT able to host spectators. Please 
 find another location along the riverfront from which to enjoy the race. \
 nNote: prospective competitors should register online at Regatta Central. 
 \nThe races begin launching at 6:30 am and will finish before noon. Best v
 iewing: 7 am-10:30 am. \n

DESCRIPTION:PETALUMA --\n\nCopperfield’s Books is honored to welcome Nem
 onte Nenquimo and Mitch Anderson to Petaluma for the launch of their impas
 sioned memoir - We Will Be Jaguars: A Memoir of My People.\n\nThe discussi
 on will be followed by a Q&A and book signing.\n\nThis is a free event\, r
 egistration recommended.\n\nFrom a fearless\, internationally acclaimed ac
 tivist comes an impassioned memoir about an indigenous childhood\, a clash
  of cultures\, and the fight to save the Amazon rainforest   We Will B
 e Jaguars is an astonishing memoir by an equally astonishing woman. Nenqui
 mo is a winner of TIME magazine’s Earth Award\, and MS. magazine named t
 his book among the Most Anticipated Feminist Books of 2024.\n\nBorn into t
 he Waorani tribe of Ecuador’s Amazon rainforest—one of the last to be 
 contacted by missionaries in the 1950s—Nemonte Nenquimo had a singular u
 pbringing.  \n\nShe was taught about plant medicines\, foraging\, oral
  storytelling\, and shamanism by her elders. At age fourteen\, she left th
 e forest for the first time to study with an evangelical missionary group 
 in the city. Eventually\, her ancestors began appearing in her dreams\, pl
 eading with her to return and embrace her own culture. She listened.\n\nTw
 o decades later\, Nemonte has emerged as one of the most forceful voices i
 n climate change activism. She has spearheaded the alliance of indigenous 
 nations across the Upper Amazon and led her people to a landmark victory a
 gainst Big Oil\, protecting over a half million acres of primary rainfores
 t. Her message is as sharp as a spear—honed by her experiences battling 
 loggers\, miners\, oil companies and missionaries.  \n\nIn We Will Be 
 Jaguars\, she partners with her husband\, Mitch Anderson\, founder of Amaz
 on Frontlines\, digging into generations of oral history\, uprooting centu
 ries of conquest\, hacking away at racist notions of indigenous peoples\, 
 and ultimately revealing a life story as rich\, harsh\, and vital as the A
 mazon rainforest herself.\n\nAuthors: Nemonte Nenquimo\, a Waorani leader\
 , was born in Ecuador's Amazon\, one of the most bio-diverse and threatene
 d rainforests on the planet. She is the co-founder of both the Indigenous-
 led non-profit Ceibo Alliance and its partner organization\, Amazon Frontl
 ines. Nemonte led her people in an historic legal victory against the oil 
 industry\, protecting half a million acres of rainforest and setting a pre
 cedent for Indigenous rights across the region. Her leadership has been wi
 dely recognized\; in 2020\, she won the Goldman Environmental Prize for Ce
 ntral and South America and was named in the BBC’s 100 Women list and th
 e TIME list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.   \n\nMit
 ch Anderson is co-founder and Executive Director of Amazon Frontlines\, a 
 non-profit organization based in the Upper Amazon\, which defends Indigeno
 us peoples' rights to land\, life\, and cultural survival. In 2011\, he mo
 ved to Ecuador's northern Amazon to start a grassroots clean water project
  with Indigenous communities living downriver from contaminating oil opera
 tions. Through building more than 1\,000 clean water systems in over 70 vi
 llages\, Mitch supported the formation of the Ceibo Alliance\, an Indigeno
 us-led non-profit that won the prestigious UN Equator Prize and whose vict
 ories for the Amazon rainforest have inspired millions worldwide.\nEvent L
